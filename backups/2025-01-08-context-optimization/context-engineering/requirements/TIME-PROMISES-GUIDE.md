# TIME PROMISES - WHAT TO SAY AND NOT SAY

## ‚ùå DON'T Make Specific Time Promises

### Never Promise:
- "We'll be there in 45 minutes"
- "30-minute response time"
- "We arrive within 1 hour"
- "2-hour repair guarantee"
- "Fixed in 90 minutes or less"

**Why**: We can't control traffic, previous job complications, or emergency situations.

## ‚úÖ DO Use Flexible Time Language

### Good Alternatives:
- "Same-day service available"
- "Quick response times"
- "Fast, efficient service"
- "Priority scheduling for emergencies"
- "Flexible appointment times"
- "We work around your schedule"

### Professional Phrases:
- "We offer same-day service throughout Toronto and GTA"
- "Our goal is to get to you as quickly as possible"
- "Most repairs completed on the first visit"
- "We understand urgency and prioritize accordingly"
- "Quick, professional service you can count on"

## üìù Time-Related Content Guidelines

### For Service Descriptions:
**Instead of**: "Our technicians arrive in 45 minutes"
**Write**: "Our technicians provide prompt, same-day service"

**Instead of**: "2-hour repair completion"
**Write**: "Most repairs completed on the first visit"

**Instead of**: "30-minute callback guarantee"
**Write**: "Quick response to all inquiries"

### For Emergency Situations:
**Good**: "Emergency service available - we prioritize urgent calls"
**Bad**: "Emergency response in 30 minutes guaranteed"

### For Booking Content:
**Good**: "Book now for same-day service"
**Bad**: "Book now - technician arrives in 1 hour"

## üéØ Setting Realistic Expectations

### What We CAN Promise:
- Same-day service availability

## üìû Phone Script Guidelines

When customers ask "How soon can you be here?"

**Good Response**: 
"We offer same-day service and will work to get to you as quickly as possible. What time works best for your schedule today?"

**Not**: 
"We'll be there in 45 minutes"
