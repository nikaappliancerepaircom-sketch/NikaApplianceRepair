# USER-FRIENDLY CONTENT GUIDE - SERVICE BUSINESS

## üéØ The Golden Rule: Help First, Sell Second

### What Users REALLY Want (In Order)
1. **Is this my problem?** (Recognize their situation)
2. **Can you fix it?** (Show capability)
3. **How much?** (Be transparent)
4. **When?** (Availability)
5. **Can I trust you?** (Prove it)
6. **How do I start?** (Make it easy)

## üìù WRITING HELPFUL CONTENT

### The "Friend Test"
Write like you're helping a friend, not selling to a stranger.

**Bad (Salesy)**: "We offer premium appliance repair solutions leveraging cutting-edge diagnostic technology."

**Good (Friendly)**: "Fridge stopped working? We offer same-day service to fix it. Most repairs completed on the first visit."

### Answer Real Questions
People don't search for "appliance repair solutions"
They search for:
- "Why is my fridge leaking water?"
- "Washing machine won't spin"
- "Is it worth fixing a 10-year-old dryer?"

### The 3-Second Rule
Users decide in 3 seconds if your page helps them.
- First sentence must match their search
- Show you understand their problem
- Give them hope (you can fix it)

## üè† SERVICE BUSINESS CONTENT STRUCTURE

### 1. The "I Get You" Opening
Show you understand their situation immediately.

**Template**:
"[Appliance] not working properly? We know how frustrating it is when your [specific problem]. The good news: [solution available]."

**Example**:
"Washing machine won't drain? We know how stressful it is with laundry piling up. The good news: we can fix most drainage issues in under 2 hours."

### 2. The "Here's What Happens" Section
People fear the unknown. Walk them through it.

```
What to Expect:
1. Call us (or book online)
2. We schedule your service quickly
3. Diagnose the problem (free with repair)
4. Show you the issue and quote
5. Fix it with your approval
6. Test everything works
7. Clean up our work area
8. 90-day warranty starts
```

### 3. The "Common Problems" Section
Help them self-diagnose (builds trust).

**Format**:
Problem: [What they notice]
Likely Cause: [Simple explanation]
Our Fix: [What we do]
Cost Range: [Honest pricing]
Time: [How long it takes]

### 4. The "Why Us" Section (But Make It About Them)
Don't list features, show benefits.

**Instead of**: "We have 5 years experience"
**Write**: "5 years fixing Toronto appliances means we've seen your problem before and know exactly how to fix it"

**Instead of**: "Licensed and insured"
**Write**: "Licensed and insured for your protection - if anything goes wrong (rare), you're covered"

## üí¨ CONVERSATIONAL WRITING TIPS

### Use "You" and "We"
- "You need your fridge working today"
- "We'll be there within an hour"
- "Your appliance will work like new"

### Write at Grade 8 Level
- Short sentences (15-20 words)
- Common words (fix not remediate)
- Active voice (we fix, not repairs are performed)
- One idea per paragraph

### Include Emotion (They're Stressed!)
Acknowledge their situation:
- "We know it's stressful"
- "Don't worry, we've got this"
- "You'll be back to normal soon"

### Be Specific, Not Vague
**Vague**: "Fast service"
**Specific**: "Same-day service available"

**Vague**: "Affordable pricing"
**Specific**: "$150-$350 for most repairs"

## üì± MOBILE-FRIENDLY CONTENT

### The Thumb Rule
Important info should be in the middle 60% of screen where thumbs easily reach.

### Scannable Format
- Bold key information
- Bullet points for lists
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines)
- Clear headings every 300 words
- White space between sections

### Progressive Disclosure
Show essential info first, details on demand.

## üîç LOCAL CONTENT THAT CONNECTS

### Neighborhood Knowledge
"Serving Yorkville's high-rise condos with same-day service. We know the service elevator procedures at most buildings."

### Local Problems
"Toronto's hard water causes extra strain on dishwashers. We see it daily and know exactly what parts wear out first."

### Weather-Relevant Content
"July in Toronto means AC units and fridges working overtime. If yours stops during a heat wave, we prioritize emergency calls."

## ‚úÖ HELPFUL CONTENT CHECKLIST

### Before You Write
- [ ] What exact problem am I solving?
- [ ] What's their emotional state?
- [ ] What do they need to know first?
- [ ] What concerns might they have?
- [ ] How can I make this easier?

### While Writing
- [ ] Did I answer their question in paragraph 1?
- [ ] Is my language conversational?
- [ ] Am I being helpful or just selling?
- [ ] Would I find this useful?
- [ ] Is it easy to scan on mobile?

### After Writing
- [ ] Read it aloud - does it sound natural?
- [ ] Show prices and availability clearly?
- [ ] Include multiple contact options?
- [ ] Add trust signals naturally?
- [ ] Clear next step to take?

## üöÄ CONTENT THAT CONVERTS

### The Trust Ladder
Build trust step by step:
1. "We understand your problem"
2. "We've fixed it many times"
3. "Here's how we'll fix yours"
4. "This is what it costs"
5. "Here's our guarantee"
6. "Ready to help you now"

### Urgency Without Pressure
**Good**: "Same-day appointments available"
**Bad**: "CALL NOW OR LOSE OUT!!!"

**Good**: "Summer special: Save $40"
**Bad**: "LIMITED TIME - ACT FAST!!!"

### Multiple Contact Options
Different people prefer different methods:
- Phone (older customers)
- Text (millennials)
- Online booking (tech-savvy)
- Email (detail-oriented)

## üìà MEASURE WHAT MATTERS

### User Satisfaction Metrics
- Time on page (are they reading?)
- Scroll depth (are they engaged?)
- Bounce rate (did we answer their question?)
- Conversion rate (did they take action?)

### Content Improvements Based on Data
- **High bounce rate?** ‚Üí Improve opening paragraph
- **Low time on page?** ‚Üí Add visuals or break up text
- **Low conversion?** ‚Üí Make CTAs clearer
- **Poor scroll depth?** ‚Üí Better formatting needed

## üéØ THE 2025 CONTENT MOTTO

"If it doesn't help the customer, it doesn't belong on the page."

Every word should either:
- Answer a question
- Solve a problem
- Build trust
- Make booking easier

That's it. No fluff, no filler, just helpful content that converts.
