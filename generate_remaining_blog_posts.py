DIY bulb replacement costs $5-$15 and takes 5 minutes (success rate: 90%). Door switch replacement costs $80-$150 professionally. Most fixes are simple DIY repairs requiring no tools.",

Spring mechanism fails. Switch gets stuck with food debris or ice buildup. Common in older Whirlpool and GE models.", "Replace door switch ($80-$150 professional, or $20 DIY)."),
            ("Loose Bulb or Poor Connection", "10%", "Light flickers when door opens/closes. Works intermittently. Light dims when compressor starts.", "Bulb not screwed in tightly. Vibration from compressor loosens bulb. Socket corrosion prevents good electrical contact.", "Tighten bulb, clean socket contacts (DIY, $0, 2 minutes). Success rate: 80%."),
            ("Damaged Light Socket", "3%", "Bulb is good but won't light up. Socket looks corroded, burned, or cracked. Smell of burning plastic.", "Electrical short damages socket. Water/moisture causes corrosion. Bulb stuck in socket, base breaks off when removing. Rare but requires professional fix.", "Replace light socket ($100-$150 professional)."),

GFCI outlet tripped. Wiring issue. Power surge damage. Check if other kitchen appliances working.", "Reset breaker (DIY, $0). If recurring, electrician needed ($150-$300)."),
            ("Faulty LED Light Assembly", "1%", "LED light dim or flickering. Multiple LED sections out. Modern fridge with LED strips.", "LED driver board failure. LED strip burned out. Common in newer Samsung and LG models with LED lighting systems.", "Replace LED assembly ($120-$200 professional).")
