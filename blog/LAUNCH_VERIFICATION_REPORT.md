## Next Steps (Required Before Launch)

### Step 1: Update Workflow for Full Publishing Schedule ⏳
The current workflow needs to be updated to:
- Publish 5 posts per day at different times (6 AM, 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM UTC)
- Adjust timezone from UTC to local time
- Configure cron expressions for Oct 31 - Nov 12 (if including old posts)

### Step 2: Test Workflow Trigger ⏳
- Go to GitHub Actions tab
- Run workflow manually with `--day day-1`
- Verify posts appear on website
- Verify Slack notifications (if configured)

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets (If Using Deployment)
If using FTP, SSH, or other deployment methods, configure:
- `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USERNAME`, `FTP_PASSWORD` (FTP)
- `DEPLOY_HOST`, `DEPLOY_USER`, `DEPLOY_KEY` (SSH)
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` (Netlify)

### Step 4: Set Up Monitoring
- [ ] Google Search Console set up for domain
- [ ] GA4 tracking verified
- [ ] Slack notifications configured (optional)
- [ ] Daily monitoring schedule planned

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items
- ✅ Script has been tested successfully
- ✅ Sample posts published without errors
- ✅ All files in correct locations
- ✅ CSS paths verified
- ✅ Backup plan exists (manual publishing if automation fails)

### Medium Risk Items
- ⚠️ Workflow timing needs adjustment for 5 slots per day
- ⚠️ Need to determine what to do with 44 original posts (published Oct 31-Nov 12?)
- ⚠️ GitHub Actions rate limiting (GitHub allows free tier actions)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **If automation fails:** Manual publishing script can run independently
2. **If posts don't deploy:** Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
3. **If CSS doesn't load:** Verify CSS files are deployed to server
4. **If indexation is slow:** Manually submit sitemap to Google Search Console
