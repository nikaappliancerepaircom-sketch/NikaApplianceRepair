## Your Role (Monitoring)

  ‚Üí github.com/[user]/NikaApplianceRepair/actions

‚ñ° Should show ‚úÖ green checkmark
‚ñ° Check Vercel dashboard
  ‚Üí vercel.com/dashboard
‚ñ° Latest deployment should be "production"
‚ñ° Visit website and verify new post appears
```

### 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 6:00 PM Checks
- Repeat the same process
- Each time: verify workflow ran and post appears
- Takes 2 minutes per check

### Evening Check
- Count total posts published (should be 5)
- All have correct styling?
- Any errors in logs?
- Document for next day

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Workflow Failed?
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Click on the failed run
3. Expand the failed step
4. Read the error
5. Common fixes:
   - Check draft folder exists
   - Check files aren't locked
   - Manually run: `python scripts/auto-publish-posts.py --day day-1`

### Post Didn't Appear?
1. Check Vercel deployment succeeded
   - Go to Vercel ‚Üí Deployments
   - Look for latest deployment
   - Should show "Ready"
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Check file permissions
4. Visit direct URL: `/blog/troubleshooting/[filename]`

### CSS Styling Broken?
1. Check paths in HTML: should be `../../css/blog-premium.css`
2. Verify CSS files deployed to Vercel
3. Check browser console for 404 errors
4. May need to manually verify CSS was deployed

## Emergency Actions

## Success Signs

‚úÖ **Everything is Working If:**
- GitHub Actions shows ‚úÖ green checkmark
- Vercel shows "Ready" status
- Post appears on website within 5 minutes
- Page has correct styling (blue headers, footer)
- Post has all sections (intro, body, FAQ, related posts)

‚ùå **Something is Wrong If:**
- GitHub Actions shows red ‚úó
- Post doesn't appear after 10 minutes
- Page looks broken (no CSS, no formatting)
- Browser console shows 404 errors
- Vercel shows "Failed"

---

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Manually publish posts while automation runs (will create duplicates)
- Edit draft files during publishing (will cause conflicts)
- Push changes to GitHub manually (will interfere with automation)
- Restart GitHub Actions while it's running (will create incomplete commits)
- Force push to main branch (will break Vercel deployment)

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Monitor and verify
- Let automation do its job
- Only manually publish if automation fails
- Check logs if something seems wrong
- Ask for help if confused
