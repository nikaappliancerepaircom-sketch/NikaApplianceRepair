    ↓
📝 GitHub Actions triggers auto-publish workflow
    ↓
🐍 Python script publishes 1 post from /blog/_drafts/day-1/
    ↓
📤 Commit pushed to GitHub (main branch)
    ↓
🚀 Vercel detects commit and auto-deploys
    ↓

## Vercel Deployment Flow

1. **GitHub Actions** (scheduled)
   - Runs Python script
   - Moves 1 post from drafts to published
   - Updates sitemap
   - Commits to GitHub (main branch)

2. **GitHub**
   - Receives commit
   - Triggers webhook to Vercel

3. **Vercel**
   - Receives webhook notification
   - Rebuilds site (~1-2 minutes)
   - Deploys to production
   - Site goes live

4. **Your Website**
   - New post accessible at `/blog/troubleshooting/[slug]`
   - Old URLs still work
   - All CSS and images loading correctly

---

## Risk Mitigation

✅ **Low Risk Setup**
- Fully automated (no manual steps needed)
- Can be paused anytime
- Posts are created manually beforehand
- No data loss risk
- Vercel provides rollback capability

✅ **Backup Plan**
If automation fails:
- Manually run: `python scripts/auto-publish-posts.py --day day-1`
- Manually commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Manual publish"`
- Manually push: `git push origin main`
- Vercel will still auto-deploy

✅ **Monitoring**
- GitHub Actions shows all runs
- Vercel shows all deployments
- No hidden failures
- Can check any time

---

## Timezone Guide

- No duplicates or thin content
- Proper schema markup
- Internal linking structure

✅ **Proper SEO Foundation**
- Sitemap.xml submitted
