                    <h2>Introduction: Why Oven Repair Costs Skyrocket</h2>
                    <p>Your oven is one of the most critical appliances in your home, yet it's often neglected in maintenance routines. Improper cleaning and handling can lead to costly repairs: heating element replacement ($200-$400), temperature sensor issues ($200-$300), or control board failure ($300+). A single repair can exceed $500-$1,000 depending on the problem.</p>
                    <p>The good news: most oven and stove problems are preventable through simple maintenance and careful handling. This guide reveals the safe cleaning methods, inspection techniques, and preventive practices that keep your oven functioning for 15-20 years without major repairs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key principle:</strong> Invest $50-$100 annually in preventive care to avoid $300-$600 emergency repair costs. The ROI is immediate and substantial.</p>

                    <h3>The Baking Soda Paste Method (Safe & Effective)</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turn off oven completely and allow to cool for 30+ minutes</li>
                        <li>Mix baking soda with water (ratio: 3 parts baking soda to 1 part water) to create paste</li>
                        <li>Apply paste to interior oven surfaces (avoid heating elements)</li>
                        <li>Let paste sit for 12-24 hours for best results</li>
                        <li>Wipe away paste with soft, damp cloth</li>
                        <li>Rinse with clean water multiple times until all residue is gone</li>
                        <li>Dry interior with soft cloth</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Baking soda is a mild alkaline that dissolves buildup without harsh chemicals. It's safe for all oven surfaces and effective at removing stubborn residue without damaging heating elements or interiors.</p>

                    <h3>Why Commercial Oven Cleaners Are Risky</h3>
                    <p>Commercial oven cleaners are caustic and contain chemicals that can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Damage heating element insulation if they come in contact</li>
                        <li>Create toxic fumes if not properly ventilated</li>
                        <li>Leave chemical residue on cooking surfaces</li>
                        <li>Corrode interior walls over time</li>
                        <li>Create safety hazards for your family</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Safe, non-toxic baking soda paste achieves the same result without the risk.</p>

                        <h3>How much does oven heating element replacement cost?</h3>
                        <p>Oven heating element replacement costs $200-$400 depending on element type and accessibility. Professional installation is required. DIY replacement risks damaging the element or electrical connections. Prevention through safe cleaning and proper use is far less expensive.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I clean oven heating elements?</h3>
                        <p>No. Never clean heating elements directly. You'll damage them and create electrical hazards. Clean around elements with non-abrasive methods only. Extreme heat from self-cleaning cycles can damage elements over timeâ€”use cautiously.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What's the safest way to clean an oven?</h3>
                        <p>Use non-abrasive methods: baking soda paste (baking soda + water) applied to cool oven surfaces, then wipe with soft cloth. Avoid harsh commercial cleaners that can damage heating elements. Never scrape interior walls or elements. For self-cleaning ovens, use sparingly as extreme heat can reduce element lifespan.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How often should I clean my oven?</h3>
                        <p>Clean oven every 3-6 months as needed (depending on usage frequency). Regular light cleaning prevents heavy buildup that requires harsh scrubbing. Wipe up spills immediately while surface is cool to prevent burned-on residue.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What causes electric stove coil failure?</h3>
                        <p>Spill damage is the leading cause of coil failure. Food and liquid corrosion cause cracks and shorts. Moisture can cause coils to fail. Keep coils clean and dry. Replace damaged coils immediately ($50-$150 depending on type) to prevent complete stove failure.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I know if my gas stove burner needs repair?</h3>
                        <p>Warning signs: uneven or yellow/orange flames (should be blue), burner won't ignite, pilot light won't stay lit, or burning smell. These indicate burner misalignment, gas flow problems, or ignition issues. Call a technician for safety inspection and repair.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is my gas stove safe if I smell gas?</h3>
                        <p>No. If you smell gas, turn off the stove immediately and ventilate the area. Do not use the stove. Call your gas company or a certified technician immediately. Gas leaks are serious safety hazards. Never attempt DIY repairs on gas connections.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much does professional oven repair cost?</h3>
                        <p>Service call: $150-$250. Heating element replacement: $200-$400. Temperature sensor replacement: $200-$300. Thermostat repair: $250-$350. Control panel issues: $300+. Preventive maintenance ($50-$100 annually) is far less expensive than repair costs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long should an oven last?</h3>
                        <p>With proper maintenance and care, a quality oven lasts 15-20 years. Without maintenance, lifespan drops to 10-12 years. Improper cleaning or damage can significantly reduce lifespan. Electric coil stoves last 13-15 years, gas stoves 15-18 years with proper maintenance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I use the self-cleaning oven feature?</h3>
                        <p>Use sparingly, if at all. Self-cleaning cycles reach 900Â°F+ which strains heating elements and insulation. Frequent use reduces element lifespan. For regular cleaning, use safe manual methods instead. Reserve self-cleaning for occasional heavy buildup only.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What maintenance do gas stoves require?</h3>
                        <p>Monthly: Check for even, blue flames and proper ignition. Quarterly: Clean burner caps and check gas connections for leaks. Annually: Professional inspection for safety, leak detection, burner alignment, and venturi tube cleaning. Gas stoves require more maintenance than electric for safety.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do I need professional oven maintenance?</h3>
                        <p>Annual professional inspection ($50-$100) catches issues early before they become expensive repairs. Technicians can identify heating element wear, temperature sensor problems, and potential safety hazards. This preventive approach saves $300-$600 annually in avoided emergency repairs.</p>
