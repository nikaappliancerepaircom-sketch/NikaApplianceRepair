            <!-- Quick Answer Box -->
            <div class="quick-answer">
                <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> A refrigerator should run 8-12 hours daily (cycling on/off every 15-20 minutes), not continuously 24/7. Constant running is caused by dirty condenser coils (40% of cases), thermostat failure (20%), or defrost issues (20%). DIY fixes like cleaning coils succeed 60% of the time. Toronto repair costs $120-$350. A constantly running fridge wastes $120-$180 annually in extra electricity.

                <h2>When Is It Normal for a Refrigerator to Run Constantly?</h2>

                <p>Before diagnosing a problem, understand when continuous running is actually normal:</p>

                <h3>Normal Situations (Temporary Constant Running):</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First 24 hours after installation:</strong> New refrigerators run continuously to reach target temperature.</li>
                    <li><strong>After restocking with warm food:</strong> Large grocery haul requires extra cooling for 2-6 hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hot Toronto summers (30¬∞C+):</strong> May run 60-70% of time (14-16 hours daily) which is acceptable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Door left open accidentally:</strong> Runs constantly until temperature restored (2-4 hours).</li>
                    <li><strong>After defrosting:</strong> Needs 24 hours to stabilize temperature.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Normal Duty Cycle:</h3>
                <p>A healthy refrigerator:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Runs 8-12 hours per day (30-50% duty cycle)</li>
                    <li>Cycles on for 8-12 minutes, off for 8-12 minutes</li>
                    <li>Compressor stops completely during off cycles</li>
                    <li>You should hear periods of silence</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Abnormal: Requires Diagnosis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Running 24/7 for more than 48 hours</li>
                    <li>Never hearing compressor stop</li>
                    <li>Running constantly in cool weather (15-20¬∞C)</li>
                    <li>Significant increase in electricity bills</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="common-causes" class="content-section">
                <h2>7 Common Causes of Refrigerator Running Constantly</h2>

                <p>This issue accounts for 18% of refrigerator service calls in Toronto and significantly increases energy costs.</p>

                <h3>1. Dirty Condenser Coils</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 40% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Compressor runs continuously. Refrigerator sides feel very hot. Fridge struggles to stay cold. Dust visible on coils.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Coils accumulate dust, pet hair, and debris over 6-12 months. Prevents heat dissipation. Compressor works harder and longer to cool. Toronto homes with pets or dusty environments especially prone.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Clean condenser coils (DIY, $0, 20 minutes). Success rate: 60%.</p>

                <h3>2. Faulty Temperature Control Thermostat</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 20% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fridge runs continuously regardless of temperature setting. Temperature dial has no effect. Fridge too cold (items freezing) or too warm.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Thermostat fails to signal compressor to stop when target temperature reached. Electrical contacts wear out over time (8-10 years). GE and Frigidaire models have known thermostat issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace thermostat ($130-$220 professional).</p>

                <h3>3. Defrost System Failure</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 20% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Ice buildup on evaporator coils. Freezer section has heavy frost. Fridge not cooling efficiently despite constant running. Temperature gradually rising.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Defrost heater, timer, or thermostat fails. Ice accumulates on evaporator coils, blocking airflow. Compressor runs constantly trying to compensate. Common in frost-free models.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace defrost system component ($160-$280 professional).</p>

                <h3>4. Damaged Door Seal (Gasket)</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 15% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Frost around door edges. Feel cold air escaping. Door doesn't seal tightly. Compressor runs continuously trying to maintain temperature.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Rubber gasket cracks from age (Toronto's dry winter air accelerates this). Gasket dirty with food residue. Door misalignment causing seal gaps.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Clean or replace gasket ($100-$180 professional). DIY cleaning success: 40%.</p>

                <h3>5. Refrigerant Leak (Sealed System)</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 3% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Compressor runs 24/7 but fridge not cold enough. Temperature gradually rising over days/weeks. Compressor very hot. Oil spots near compressor.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Pinhole leak in sealed refrigerant system. Refrigerant escapes slowly. Compressor can't reach target temperature, runs continuously.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Sealed system repair ($400-$600) or replace unit if over 10 years old.</p>

                <h3>6. Ambient Temperature Too High</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1% chronic cases (seasonal issue)</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fridge runs constantly only in summer or hot location. Works normally in cooler months. Room temperature above 30¬∞C (85¬∞F).</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Refrigerator in hot garage, near oven, or in direct sunlight. Toronto summer heat (30-35¬∞C) combined with poor ventilation. Fridge designed for 15-25¬∞C ambient temperature.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Relocate fridge, improve ventilation, or accept higher duty cycle in summer (may run 60-70% of time).</p>

                <h3>7. Compressor Relay or Capacitor Failure</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Compressor starts but struggles to run efficiently. Clicking sounds. Runs continuously but weak cooling. Compressor very hot.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Start relay or run capacitor fails. Compressor doesn't operate at full capacity. Runs continuously trying to compensate.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace relay/capacitor ($150-$250 professional).</p>

                        <li>Compressor should turn on/off with dial changes</li>
                        <li>If no click or no response, thermostat likely faulty</li>
                        <li>Try turning dial to off position (if available)</li>
                        <li>Compressor should stop within 2-3 minutes</li>
                        <li>If compressor keeps running, thermostat or control board faulty</li>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is it normal for a refrigerator to run constantly?</h3>
                    <p>A refrigerator should cycle on and off every 15-20 minutes, running 8-12 hours daily (30-50% duty cycle). If your fridge runs 24/7 without stopping, it's abnormal and indicates dirty condenser coils (40% of cases), thermostat failure (20%), or refrigerant leak (15%). Normal exceptions: first 24 hours after installation, after restocking with warm food, during hot Toronto summers (may run 60-70% of time). If your fridge has been running constantly for more than 48 hours in normal conditions, diagnosis required. A constantly running compressor will fail prematurely (5-8 years instead of 12-15 years) and costs $120-$180 annually in extra electricity.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does my refrigerator run all the time and won't shut off?</h3>
                    <p>Refrigerators run constantly due to dirty condenser coils preventing heat dissipation (40%), defrost system failure causing ice buildup (20%), faulty thermostat not signaling compressor to stop (20%), or damaged door seals allowing warm air in (15%). Less common: refrigerant leak or compressor failure. Check if coils are dusty - this is easiest DIY fix with 60% success rate. Simply unplug fridge, pull away from wall, vacuum coils thoroughly, push back, and monitor for 24 hours. Most Toronto homes need coil cleaning every 6 months (every 3 months with pets). If cleaning doesn't help, professional diagnosis needed to test thermostat and defrost system.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much electricity does a refrigerator use running constantly?</h3>
                    <p>A refrigerator running 24/7 consumes 150-200 kWh monthly versus normal 80-100 kWh. In Toronto (Toronto Hydro rate $0.15/kWh), that's $22.50-$30/month versus normal $12-$15/month. Extra cost: $10-$15 monthly or $120-$180 annually. Over 5 years: $600-$900 wasted. Repair usually costs $120-$350, paying for itself in 1-2 years through energy savings. Plus constant running shortens compressor lifespan significantly - premature compressor replacement costs $400-$600. Check your Toronto Hydro bill - if it's increased 20-30% without other explanation, your fridge may be the culprit. Use a plug-in energy monitor ($25-$40) to measure exact consumption.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How often should a refrigerator compressor cycle?</h3>
                    <p>Healthy refrigerator compressor cycles on and off every 15-20 minutes. It runs 8-12 minutes (cooling), then stops 8-12 minutes (resting). Daily runtime: 8-12 hours (30-50% duty cycle). If compressor runs continuously without stopping for hours, or cycles every 2-3 minutes (short cycling), there's a problem requiring diagnosis. Listen for compressor - should be quiet hum, not loud or continuous. Stand next to fridge for 5 minutes - you should hear it turn off at least once. In hot Toronto summers (30¬∞C+), duty cycle may increase to 60-70% (14-16 hours daily) which is acceptable. Newer energy-efficient models may have different patterns but should still cycle regularly.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can a refrigerator running constantly cause damage?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, continuous running shortens compressor lifespan from 12-15 years to 5-8 years. Constant operation causes: compressor overheating and premature failure, increased wear on fan motors, higher energy bills ($120-$180 annually extra), and potential food spoilage if cooling becomes inefficient. Address issue within 1-2 weeks to prevent expensive compressor replacement ($400-$600 Toronto). Additionally, constant running can cause: evaporator coil freeze-up requiring manual defrost, premature capacitor failure ($150-$250 repair), and increased risk of sealed system leaks. Don't ignore this problem - it only gets worse and more expensive over time. Early diagnosis and repair saves money long-term.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if my refrigerator thermostat is bad?</h3>
                    <p>Test thermostat: Turn dial from lowest to highest setting - should hear click as compressor turns on/off. If no click, or fridge ignores temperature changes, thermostat is faulty. Other signs: fridge too cold (items freezing) or too warm, constant running without cycling, or dial turns without resistance. Thermostat replacement costs $130-$220 in Toronto including labor. DIY testing takes 5 minutes. Some digital thermostats have diagnostic modes - consult manual. If thermostat clicks but fridge still runs constantly, problem may be defrost system, dirty coils, or sealed system. Professional multimeter testing can definitively diagnose thermostat within 10 minutes. Don't replace thermostat unnecessarily - get proper diagnosis first.</p>
