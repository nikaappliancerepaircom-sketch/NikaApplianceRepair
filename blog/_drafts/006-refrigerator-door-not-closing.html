                <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> A refrigerator door that won't close is typically caused by a damaged door seal/gasket (45% of cases), unlevel refrigerator (25%), or misaligned hinges (15%). DIY fixes include cleaning the gasket, leveling the fridge, and removing obstructions (success rate: 60%). Professional gasket replacement in Toronto costs $100-$180. An improperly closing door wastes 25% more energy and risks food spoilage.

                <h2>6 Common Causes of Refrigerator Door Not Closing Properly</h2>

                <p>In Toronto, door closing problems account for 15% of all refrigerator service calls. This seemingly minor issue leads to higher energy bills, frost buildup, and food spoilage if not addressed quickly.</p>

                <h3>1. Damaged or Dirty Door Gasket (Seal)</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 45% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Door doesn't seal tightly when closed. Frost builds up around door edges. You can feel cold air escaping. Higher electricity bills noticed.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Rubber gasket accumulates food residue, grease, and mold preventing proper seal. Cold Toronto winters make rubber brittle and crack. Normal wear over 5-7 years. Samsung and LG french-door models have thinner gaskets prone to failure.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Clean gasket thoroughly (DIY, $0). Replace if damaged ($100-$180 professional).</p>

                <h3>2. Refrigerator Not Level</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 25% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Door doesn't swing closed automatically. Refrigerator appears tilted forward. Door stays open at any position instead of closing.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Toronto homes (especially older ones) have uneven floors. Front leveling legs not properly adjusted. Foundation settling over time. Floor sagging under refrigerator weight (common in condos).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Level refrigerator by adjusting legs (DIY, $0, 15 minutes). Success rate: 85%.</p>

                <h3>3. Misaligned or Damaged Door Hinges</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 15% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Door hangs crooked. Gap visible between door and cabinet. Door scrapes against refrigerator body. Hinge makes squeaking or grinding sounds.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Hinges loosen over time from repeated door opening. Screws strip out from door weight. French-door models with heavy doors stress hinges. Moving refrigerator damages hinges.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Tighten hinge screws (DIY, $0). Replace hinges if damaged ($150-$250 professional).</p>

                <h3>4. Overstuffed Refrigerator</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 10% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Door pushes against items inside. Can't close door completely. Hear items falling when closing. Door bounces back when trying to close.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Shelves overloaded with groceries. Large items (pizza boxes, watermelons) stick out. Containers placed too far forward. Very common after Costco shopping trips in Toronto.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Reorganize contents, remove obstructions (DIY, $0, 10 minutes). Success rate: 95%.</p>

                <h3>5. Warped or Bent Door</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 3% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Door doesn't sit flush against cabinet. Visible gap that varies at different points. Door twisted or bent appearance when viewed from front.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Door overloaded with heavy items in door bins. Door left open and someone leaned on it. Manufacturing defect (rare). Extreme temperature changes during moving.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Professional door realignment or replacement ($200-$400). Not easily DIY-fixable.</p>

                <h3>6. Broken Door Cam or Closer</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 2% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Door doesn't automatically close from half-open position even when fridge is level. Door stays at any angle. Clicking or snapping sound when opening/closing.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Self-closing door cam mechanism broken or worn. Spring mechanism failed. Common in older Whirlpool, Maytag, and GE models (10+ years).</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace door closer mechanism ($120-$200 professional).</p>

                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Proper leveling enables gravity-assisted door closing.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open refrigerator door to half-way point (45 degrees)</li>
                        <li>Release door - it should swing closed on its own</li>
                        <li>If door stays open or swings further open, fridge needs leveling</li>
                        <li>Locate front leveling legs (twist to adjust)</li>
                        <li>Use bubble level on top of fridge (side-to-side should be level)</li>
                        <li>Adjust legs so fridge tilts SLIGHTLY backward (1/4 inch)</li>
                        <li>Turn legs clockwise to raise, counter-clockwise to lower</li>
                        <li>Test door self-closing from half-open position</li>
                        <li>Fine-tune until door closes automatically</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0 (need bubble level and wrench), 15-20 minutes</p>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> Fixes 85% of leveling issues</p>
                </div>

                <div class="diy-step">

                    <h3>Step 4: Tighten All Hinge Screws</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Loose hinges cause misalignment.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open door fully to access top and bottom hinges</li>
                        <li>Remove hinge cover if present (usually snaps off)</li>
                        <li>Check all screws on each hinge</li>
                        <li>Use appropriate screwdriver (usually Phillips or hex)</li>
                        <li>Tighten each screw firmly but don't over-tighten</li>
                        <li>If screw spins without tightening, hole is stripped</li>
                        <li>For stripped holes: remove screw, insert toothpick with wood glue, let dry, re-screw</li>
                        <li>Replace hinge cover</li>
                        <li>Test door alignment and closure</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0-$5 (toothpicks and wood glue if needed), 20 minutes</p>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> Fixes 70% of loose hinge issues</p>

                    <h3>Step 5: Perform the Dollar Bill Test</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Diagnoses gasket seal problems accurately.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Take dollar bill or sheet of paper</li>
                        <li>Open door, place bill so half is inside fridge</li>
                        <li>Close door on bill (don't let go of bill yet)</li>
                        <li>Try to pull bill out slowly</li>
                        <li>Should feel resistance - bill should NOT slide out easily</li>
                        <li>Repeat at 8-10 spots around entire door perimeter</li>
                        <li>Mark any spots where bill slides out easily</li>
                        <li>Weak spots indicate gasket needs replacement</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0 (DIY), 5 minutes</p>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> 100% accurate diagnostic test</p>
                    <p><strong>Result interpretation:</strong> If bill fails test at 3+ spots, gasket replacement recommended.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why won't my refrigerator door stay closed?</h3>
                    <p>Refrigerator doors fail to stay closed due to damaged door seals/gaskets (45% of cases), unlevel refrigerator (25%), misaligned hinges (15%), or overstuffed shelves preventing door closure (10%). Check if gasket is dirty, cracked, or loose. Test by closing door on paper - if it slides out easily, seal is faulty. Most Toronto homes built before 2000 have uneven floors causing fridge leveling issues. Start with free fixes: clean gasket, level fridge, remove obstructions. These solve 60% of cases. If door still won't close, professional gasket replacement costs $100-$180 in Toronto.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does it cost to fix a refrigerator door that won't close in Toronto?</h3>
                    <p>Door seal replacement costs $100-$180 in Toronto. Hinge adjustment: $80-$120. Complete hinge replacement: $150-$250. Leveling (DIY): $0. Cleaning gasket (DIY): $0. Most door closing issues can be fixed for under $150. Professional service call fee: $80-$100 (waived with repair). Same-day service available across Toronto and GTA including North York, Scarborough, Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, and Richmond Hill.

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I replace a refrigerator door seal myself?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, replacing a refrigerator door gasket is a DIY-friendly repair. Purchase correct gasket model ($40-$80 online), soak in warm water to soften, remove old gasket by pulling from groove, clean groove thoroughly, press new gasket into place starting at top corners. Success rate: 75% for DIY. Takes 45-60 minutes. However, if hinges are bent or door is warped, professional help needed. Tips for success: order exact model number gasket, work in warm room so rubber is pliable, start at top corners and work around perimeter evenly. Many Toronto DIYers successfully complete this repair. Watch YouTube video for your specific fridge model before starting.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if my refrigerator door seal is bad?</h3>
                    <p>Test door seal with these methods: 1) Paper test - close door on paper, pull gently. Should have resistance. 2) Visual inspection - look for cracks, tears, or gaps. 3) Light test - shine flashlight inside closed fridge in dark room, look for light leaking. 4) Feel test - run hand around closed door edge, feel for air escaping. 5) Frost test - excessive frost on seal indicates air leak. If any test fails, gasket needs replacement. Dollar bill test is most accurate: close door on dollar bill at 8-10 spots around perimeter. Bill should not slide out easily anywhere. Toronto homes with dry winter air accelerate gasket deterioration, so test annually.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does my fridge door pop open after closing?</h3>
                    <p>Fridge door pops open due to air pressure changes inside refrigerator. When you close door, warm room air enters, cools rapidly, creates vacuum. If gasket seal is weak, this pressure forces door open. Other causes: overstuffed fridge creating internal pressure, misaligned door creating uneven seal, or door not closing fully before releasing. Wait 10 seconds after closing to ensure seal sets before walking away. This is especially common with French-door Samsung and LG models. If problem persists, test gasket seal with paper test - gasket likely needs replacement ($100-$180 Toronto). Temporary fix: ensure door fully closes by pushing until you hear/feel magnetic seal engage.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should a refrigerator door close by itself?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, a properly leveled refrigerator door should close automatically from a half-open position (about 45 degrees). This is achieved by tilting the fridge slightly backward using adjustable front leveling legs. Door relies on gravity to swing closed. If door doesn't self-close, refrigerator is not level or hinges are damaged. Self-closing prevents accidentally leaving door open, saving energy and preventing food spoilage. To adjust: turn front leveling legs clockwise to raise front, creating backward tilt. Test by opening door halfway and releasing - should swing closed smoothly. This is especially important in Toronto homes with active kids who may not close doors completely.</p>
