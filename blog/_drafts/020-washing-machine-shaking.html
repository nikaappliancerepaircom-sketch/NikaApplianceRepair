                <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Washing machine shaking violently is caused by unbalanced load (50%), unlevel machine (30%), or worn shock absorbers/suspension (15%). Redistribute load and level washer‚ÄîDIY fixes, $0. Shock absorber replacement costs $180-$320, drum bearing $350-$500 in Toronto. Excessive shaking damages floor, walls, and internal components‚Äîfix immediately.

                <h2>Why Does My Washing Machine Shake So Much?</h2>
                <h3>1. Unbalanced Load (50%)</h3>
                <p>Heavy items clump on one side during spin, creating imbalance and violent shaking.</p>
                <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Redistribute clothes, mix large/small items, don't overload. $0.</p>
                <h3>2. Washer Not Level (30%)</h3>
                <p>Uneven floor or improperly adjusted legs cause rocking and shaking.</p>
                <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Level washer using adjustable legs and bubble level. $0, 15 min.</p>
                <h3>3. Worn Shock Absorbers or Suspension Rods (15%)</h3>
                <p>Shock absorbers wear out (especially front loaders), allowing excessive drum movement.</p>
                <p><strong>Professional Fix:</strong> Shock absorber replacement ($180-$320 for set of 4).</p>
                <h3>4. Shipping Bolts Still Installed</h3>
                <p>Transit bolts left in from delivery prevent drum suspension from working.</p>
                <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Remove 3-4 shipping bolts from back of washer. $0, 10 min.</p>
                <h3>5. Worn Drum Bearings (Loud Grinding + Shaking)</h3>
                <p>Drum bearings fail, causing loud grinding noise plus violent shaking during spin.</p>
                <p><strong>Professional Fix:</strong> Drum bearing replacement ($350-$500 - labor intensive).</p>

                <h2>How to Fix Shaking Washing Machine</h2>
                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Redistribute and Reduce Load</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stop cycle and open washer</li>
                        <li>Check if clothes are bunched on one side</li>
                        <li>Redistribute evenly around drum</li>
                        <li>Mix heavy items (jeans, towels) with lighter items</li>
                        <li>Remove items if overloaded (max 3/4 full)</li>
                        <li>Single heavy item (bathmat, comforter) needs 2-3 towels for balance</li>
                        <li>Restart spin cycle</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> 50% if load was unbalanced</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Level the Washing Machine</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place bubble level on top of washer (front-to-back and side-to-side)</li>
                        <li>Check if bubble is centered</li>
                        <li>Adjust front leveling legs:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turn clockwise (right) to raise</li>
                            <li>Turn counter-clockwise (left) to lower</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Most washers should tilt slightly backward (helps lid close)</li>
                        <li>Tighten lock nuts on adjustable legs</li>
                        <li>Rock washer side-to-side‚Äîshould not move</li>
                        <li>If floor is uneven, use rubber anti-vibration pads ($15-$30)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> 30% if washer was unlevel</p>
                </div>
                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Check for Shipping Bolts (New Washers)</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Look at back of washer for 3-4 large bolts</li>
                        <li>Shipping bolts secure drum during transport</li>
                        <li>MUST be removed before use</li>
                        <li>Use wrench to remove all bolts</li>
                        <li>Save bolts in case you move washer later</li>
                        <li>Some models have plastic clips that snap out</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Running washer with shipping bolts causes severe shaking and damages suspension.</p>

                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Check Washer Placement</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Ensure washer isn't touching walls (needs 1" clearance)</li>
                        <li>Remove any items stored on top (adds to vibration)</li>
                        <li>Check that washer isn't on carpet (needs solid floor)</li>
                        <li>Wooden floors may flex‚Äîconsider anti-vibration pads</li>
                        <li>Washer should not be on pedestals unless specifically designed for it</li>
                    </ol>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why does my washing machine shake so much during spin cycle?</h3>
                    <p>Washing machine shaking violently is caused by unbalanced load (50% of cases), unlevel machine (30%), worn shock absorbers (15%), or shipping bolts still installed (new washers). First, redistribute clothes evenly and reduce load size. Level washer using adjustable legs‚Äîplace bubble level on top, adjust legs until level side-to-side and front-to-back. New washer? Remove shipping bolts from back (3-4 large bolts). If shaking persists after these fixes, shock absorbers or drum bearings may be worn. Toronto repair: $180-$500 depending on part. Excessive shaking damages floors and washer internals.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is it normal for washing machine to shake during spin?</h3>
                    <p>Some vibration during spin cycle is normal, especially at high RPM (1000-1400). However, violent shaking that moves washer across floor, bangs against walls, or causes noise in other rooms is NOT normal and indicates problem. Normal vibration stays within washer footprint. Excessive shaking means unbalanced load, unlevel unit, or worn suspension components.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I stop my washing machine from shaking?</h3>
                    <p>Stop washing machine shaking by: 1) Leveling washer with adjustable legs (use bubble level), 2) Loading properly‚Äîmix heavy and light items, max 3/4 full, 3) Using anti-vibration pads under legs ($15-$30), 4) Ensuring 1" clearance from walls, 5) Removing shipping bolts if new washer. For persistent shaking, check shock absorbers (front loaders) or suspension rods (top loaders)‚Äîworn parts need professional replacement ($180-$500 in Toronto).</p>
