        <h1>Dryer Not Drying Clothes: Quick Fixes & Professional Repair</h1>

        <div class="section-intro">
            <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> A dryer not drying clothes is the #1 appliance complaint in Toronto, accounting for 31% of service calls. Toronto's 70% average humidity increases lint accumulation by 40%, making vents clog faster than in dry climates. Most fixes cost just $100-$300, and 65% are DIY-fixable. This guide covers every cause from simple to complex.
        </div>

        <h2>Why Your Dryer Stopped Drying Effectively</h2>

        <p>A dryer that produces heat but doesn't dry clothes is incredibly frustrating. The good news: 70% of drying problems have simple, inexpensive solutions. The bad news: ignoring the problem risks fire hazards and appliance damage.</p>

        <p>Toronto's climate makes dryer problems worse. With average humidity of 65-75%, moisture is reabsorbed into clothes during drying. Combined with lint accumulation (40% worse than national average), Toronto dryers work harder and fail faster. Repair costs range from <strong>$100 to $300</strong> for most common issues.</p>

        <p>Major brands like <span class="brand-mention">Whirlpool</span>, <span class="brand-mention">LG</span>, and <span class="brand-mention">Samsung</span> all have similar drying mechanisms, and all struggle in Toronto's humid climate.</p>

        <h3>Toronto's Humidity Impact</h3>

        <p>Toronto's climate accelerates dryer failure:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lint accumulation:</strong> 40% faster than dry climates (Houston, Phoenix). Humidity makes lint adhere to surfaces</li>
            <li><strong>Airflow problems:</strong> Moisture in air reduces drying efficiency by 25-30%</li>
            <li><strong>Thermostat strain:</strong> Dryer must run longer to reach target temperature, increasing component wear</li>
            <li><strong>Vent clogging:</strong> Lint-clogged vents accumulate faster in humid environments</li>
            <li><strong>Moisture sensor failure:</strong> High humidity confuses moisture sensors, causing cycles to end prematurely</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="toronto-highlight">
            <strong>Toronto Data:</strong> Average humidity: 65-75% (vs. 40-50% national average). Lint filter clogs 40% faster. Dryer vent cleaning needed every 6-8 months (vs. 12 months nationally).
        </div>

        <h2>12 Most Common Causes of Poor Drying</h2>

        <h3>1. Clogged Lint Filter (Most Common)</h3>

        <p>The lint filter traps fibers during drying. A clogged filter blocks airflow, preventing proper drying. This is the #1 cause of dryer problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Clothes still damp after full cycle, dryer gets extremely hot to touch.</p>

        <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Remove lint filter and clean thoroughly. Most filters can be washed under warm water. For stubborn buildup, use old toothbrush and warm soapy water. Time: 5 minutes. Cost: Free.</p>

        <p><strong>Success Rate:</strong> 60% of "not drying" problems resolve with this simple fix.</p>

        <h3>2. Clogged Dryer Vent</h3>

        <p>The vent pipe exhausts lint and moisture outside. When clogged, drying efficiency drops 50-80%. This is both the most common problem and the biggest fire hazard.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer runs but clothes barely dry, excess heat outside vent.</p>

        <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Disconnect vent hose, check for lint blockage. Use a plumbing snake or vacuum to remove blockage. Reconnect hose securely. Time: 30 minutes. Cost: $0-$30.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix:</strong> Professional vent cleaning $150-$250 (includes full duct inspection).</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>FIRE HAZARD:</strong> A clogged dryer vent is a major fire risk. Lint is extremely flammable. If vent is clogged, stop using dryer and have it professionally cleaned before resuming use.
        </div>

        <h3>3. Blocked or Kinked Vent Hose</h3>

        <p>The flexible duct connecting dryer to wall vent can kink, bend, or separate from connections. When blocked, hot air can't escape, reducing drying efficiency.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer runs hot but clothes don't dry, steam appears at dryer front.</p>

        <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Pull dryer away from wall, inspect vent hose for kinks or separation. Straighten kinks, reconnect loose connections with hose clamps. Cost: $0-$20 for new clamps.</p>

        <h3>4. Faulty Door Latch</h3>

        <p>A failing door latch prevents dryer from functioning even when door closes. Without proper seal, moisture escapes and cycle won't start.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer won't start even though door appears closed, or door won't stay closed during cycle.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Latch replacement $100-$150.</p>

        <h3>5. Broken Thermal Fuse</h3>

        <p>The thermal fuse is a safety device that stops the dryer if it overheats. When it blows, the dryer won't run at all (not just dries poorly). This typically happens when vent is severely clogged.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer won't run at all, even though power is on. No heat production.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Thermal fuse replacement $150-$250. Note: Always clean vent and lint filter first—thermal fuse blowing indicates underlying airflow problem.</p>

        <h3>6. Faulty Heating Element</h3>

        <p>The heating element generates heat for drying. When it fails, the dryer may run but produce no heat, leaving clothes cold and damp.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer runs normally but produces no heat. Clothes are cold after cycle.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Heating element replacement $200-$300.</p>

        <h3>7. Broken Moisture Sensor</h3>

        <p>Modern dryers use sensors to detect when clothes are dry and end the cycle. A broken sensor may end the cycle too early (clothes still damp) or run too long (wasting energy).</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer shuts off before clothes are dry, even on high heat settings.</p>

        <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Clean sensor (usually inside drum). Lint and residue buildup can confuse sensors. Wipe with damp cloth. Cost: Free.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix:</strong> Sensor replacement $150-$250 if cleaning doesn't help.</p>

        <h3>8. Broken Blower Wheel</h3>

        <p>The blower wheel circulates hot air through the drum. When it breaks, airflow is severely restricted. Lint accumulation often causes this damage.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer runs but barely produces airflow. Clothes stay cold.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Blower wheel replacement $200-$350.</p>

        <h3>9. Airflow Obstruction Inside Dryer</h3>

        <p>Lint can accumulate inside the dryer housing, not just in the vent. This blocks hot air from reaching clothes.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Lint visible around drum opening, weak airflow even after cleaning filter.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Internal cleaning/lint removal $150-$200.</p>

        <h3>10. Defective Idler Pulley</h3>

        <p>The idler pulley keeps drum tension. When it wears out, the drum may stop rotating, preventing proper tumbling and drying.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Drum doesn't turn during cycle, or turns very slowly. Squeaking noise.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Idler pulley replacement $150-$250.</p>

        <h3>11. Airflow Sensor Malfunction</h3>

        <p>Some dryers have airflow sensors that monitor vent blockage. A broken sensor may shut down the dryer prematurely to prevent overheating.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Dryer shuts off after 5-10 minutes, regardless of settings.</p>

        <p><strong>Professional Fix Required:</strong> Sensor replacement $150-$250.</p>

        <h3>12. Incorrect Dryer Settings</h3>

        <p>Sometimes the solution is as simple as using wrong settings. Some people run delicate or low-heat cycles for everything, which don't dry heavy fabrics.</p>

        <p><strong>Sign:</strong> Clothes dry fine on high heat but not on low heat.</p>

        <p><strong>DIY Fix:</strong> Use higher heat setting appropriate for fabric type. Heavier fabrics (towels, jeans) need high heat to dry properly.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Clean the Lint Filter (Do This First!)</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Open dryer door and locate lint filter (usually near door opening)</li>
            <li>Pull filter straight out</li>
            <li>Empty visible lint by hand</li>
            <li>Rinse filter under warm water, wiping gently to remove trapped lint</li>
            <li>For heavy residue, use old toothbrush and warm soapy water</li>
            <li>Air dry completely, then reinstall</li>
            <li>Run a short drying cycle and check if drying improves</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 10 minutes | <strong>Cost:</strong> Free | <strong>Success Rate:</strong> 60%</p>

        <div class="success-box">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> In Toronto's humid climate, lint filters accumulate much faster. Clean filters after EVERY load, not just occasionally. This single habit prevents 80% of drying problems.
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Inspect Vent Hose and Connection</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Unplug dryer (safety first)</li>
            <li>Pull dryer away from wall (may need helper)</li>
            <li>Check where vent hose connects to dryer—should be secure with hose clamp</li>
            <li>Check where hose connects to wall vent—should be snug</li>
            <li>Feel along hose for kinks or excessive bending</li>
            <li>If hose is kinked, carefully straighten it</li>
            <li>If clamps are loose, tighten with screwdriver or wrench</li>
            <li>If hose feels crushed or damaged, replacement is needed ($20-$50 part)</li>
            <li>Plug dryer back in and test</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 20 minutes | <strong>Cost:</strong> $0-$50 | <strong>Success Rate:</strong> 40%</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Check Dryer Vent Outlet</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Go outside to your dryer vent outlet (usually on home exterior)</li>
            <li>Feel for strong air flow—it should be obvious when dryer runs</li>
            <li>Check if hood flapper moves freely (should open when dryer runs)</li>
            <li>If no airflow, vent is blocked and needs professional cleaning</li>
            <li>If airflow is weak, vent needs cleaning soon</li>
            <li>Check for visible lint accumulation around outlet</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Time:</strong> 5 minutes | <strong>Cost:</strong> Free | <strong>Diagnostic Value:</strong> Excellent</p>

        <h2>DIY Dryer Vent Cleaning</h3>

        <p>Professional vent cleaning costs $150-$250 and is recommended annually (or every 6 months in Toronto). You can DIY the basic procedure:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unplug dryer</strong> and let cool for 30 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Locate vent hose</strong> connection at back of dryer</li>
            <li><strong>Disconnect hose</strong> by loosening hose clamp with screwdriver</li>
            <li><strong>Remove lint:</strong> Pull out large lint clumps by hand</li>
            <li><strong>Use a plumbing snake:</strong> Feed flexible snake into hose, rotating to break up blockages</li>
            <li><strong>Vacuum inside:</strong> Use shop vacuum to pull lint from hose</li>
            <li><strong>Check duct:</strong> If vent extends through walls, check accessible sections</li>
            <li><strong>Reconnect:</strong> Reattach hose securely with hose clamp</li>
            <li><strong>Check outdoor vent:</strong> Verify flapper opens freely</li>
            <li><strong>Plug in and test</strong> with a short drying cycle</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0-$30 for tools (or rent snake for $10) | <strong>Time:</strong> 45 minutes</p>

        <p><strong>When to Call Professional:</strong> If vent goes through long wall runs, has multiple turns, or if DIY cleaning doesn't resolve the problem, hire professionals. They have industrial equipment and can reach blockages you can't.</p>

        <h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>

        <p>Professional repair is needed for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Dryer produces no heat (heating element likely failed)</li>
            <li>Drum doesn't turn (idler pulley or motor failure)</li>
            <li>Dryer won't start even though it's plugged in (thermal fuse blown)</li>
            <li>Repeated lint filter cleaning doesn't improve drying</li>

        <h2>FAQ Section</h2>

        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">1. Is a dryer that doesn't dry an emergency?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Not immediately, but it's a fire hazard if vent is clogged. Address within 24 hours. If you smell burning, stop using immediately.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">2. Can I use my dryer while waiting for repair?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Only if vent is clear and there's no burning smell. Using a dryer with a severely clogged vent or failed thermal fuse is a fire hazard.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">3. Why does Toronto humidity make dryers work worse?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Moisture in air (65-75% in Toronto vs. 40-50% nationally) interferes with drying. Clothes reabsorb moisture from air. Lint also adheres better in humid conditions.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">4. How often should I clean my lint filter?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">After EVERY load. In Toronto's humid climate, lint accumulates 40% faster. This single habit prevents 80% of drying problems.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">5. How often should I have my dryer vent professionally cleaned?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Nationally: every 12 months. In Toronto: every 6 months due to humidity. If you notice weak airflow at vent outlet, clean immediately.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">6. What's the difference between a clogged filter and clogged vent?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Clogged filter: clothes still damp, dryer gets hot. Clogged vent: weak airflow at outlet, no heat escaping, potential fire hazard. Both need immediate attention.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">7. Can I use a flexible metal vent hose instead of plastic?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Metal is better than plastic (more durable, less fire risk). Rigid aluminum ducts are best. Avoid foil vents—they trap lint and become fire hazards.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">8. Is it worth repairing a 10-year-old dryer?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">If repair cost is less than 50% of new dryer cost ($300+ repair on $600 new dryer), repair is worthwhile. If thermal fuse keeps blowing, replace vent system first.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">9. What causes a burning smell from my dryer?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Lint buildup igniting inside dryer (fire hazard). Stop use immediately, clean vent, and have dryer inspected professionally before resuming use.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">10. Can air conditioning help my dryer work better in Toronto humidity?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes, lowering indoor humidity helps drying efficiency slightly. However, proper vent cleaning and lint filter maintenance are more important than AC.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">11. What's wrong if dryer heats but doesn't tumble?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Idler pulley failure or belt damage. Drum doesn't turn, so clothes don't dry. Professional repair needed ($150-$250).</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleFAQ(this)">12. Should I install a dryer vent booster fan?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">For Toronto's humidity, vent booster fans ($100-$200) can help if vents are long or have multiple turns. Not necessary if vent is clean and well-designed.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
