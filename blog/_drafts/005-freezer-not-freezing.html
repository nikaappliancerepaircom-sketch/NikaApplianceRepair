                <h2>7 Common Causes of Freezer Not Freezing (But Fridge Works)</h2>

                <p>In Toronto homes, this specific problem accounts for 25% of all refrigerator service calls. The good news is that most causes are repairable and don't require replacing the entire unit.</p>

                <h3>1. Evaporator Fan Motor Failure</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 35% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Freezer gradually warms up over 24-48 hours. You don't hear the fan running when the door is closed. Fridge stays cool because it's closer to the cooling source.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The evaporator fan circulates cold air from the evaporator coils throughout both compartments. When it fails, cold air doesn't reach the freezer properly. Samsung and LG models from 2015-2020 have higher fan motor failure rates.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace evaporator fan motor. Professional repair recommended ($180-$250).</p>

                <h3>2. Defrost System Malfunction</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 30% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Heavy frost buildup on evaporator coils (behind back panel). Freezer temperature slowly rises. You may hear the compressor running constantly.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The defrost heater, defrost timer, or defrost thermostat fails. Ice accumulates on evaporator coils, blocking airflow. Common in Whirlpool and Maytag models.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace defrost system component ($120-$280 depending on part).</p>

                <h3>3. Blocked Air Vents</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 20% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Some areas of freezer are colder than others. Fridge works perfectly. Airflow seems restricted when you hold hand near vents.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Food packages block air vents between fridge and freezer. Ice buildup covers vents. Overstuffing prevents air circulation. Very common in Toronto where people stock up during cold winters.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Clear vents and reorganize contents (DIY, free). Success rate: 65%.</p>

                <h3>4. Damaged Door Seal (Gasket)</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 8% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Frost around door edges. Freezer door feels warm on outside. Higher electricity bills. You can see light or feel air when door is closed.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Rubber gasket cracks over time (especially in dry Toronto winters). Gasket becomes dirty and doesn't seal. Door hinges misaligned.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Clean or replace door gasket ($80-$150). DIY cleaning success rate: 40%.</p>

                <h3>5. Temperature Control Thermostat Issue</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 5% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Freezer temperature fluctuates wildly. Sometimes it freezes, sometimes it doesn't. Temperature dial doesn't seem to work.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The thermostat that controls cooling cycles fails. It can't properly signal the compressor when to run. GE and Frigidaire models have known thermostat issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Replace temperature control thermostat ($120-$200).</p>

                <h3>6. Low Refrigerant (Sealed System Leak)</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1-2% of cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Both fridge and freezer gradually become warmer over weeks. You might hear hissing sounds. Oil spots visible near compressor.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Very rare. Sealed system develops a leak. Refrigerant escapes slowly. This is an expensive repair.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Sealed system repair or replacement ($400-$600). Often better to replace unit.</p>

                <h3>7. Compressor Problems</h3>
                <p><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1% of freezer-specific cases</p>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Compressor runs but isn't pumping refrigerant efficiently. Both compartments affected but freezer fails first since it needs colder temperature.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Compressor wearing out (usually 10+ years old). Start relay failure.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Compressor replacement ($400-$600) or replace unit if over 10 years old.</p>

                <h2>5 DIY Troubleshooting Steps to Fix Your Freezer</h2>

                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Check and Clear Air Vents</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Blocked vents are the easiest fix with highest success rate.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Remove all items from freezer and fridge</li>
                        <li>Locate air vents (usually on back wall of freezer, or between compartments)</li>
                        <li>Check for ice buildup covering vents</li>
                        <li>Check for food packages pushed against vents</li>
                        <li>Clear at least 3 inches of space around all vents</li>
                        <li>Use a vacuum to remove dust from vent openings</li>
                        <li>Reorganize freezer with proper spacing</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0 (DIY), 20 minutes</p>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> Fixes 65% of airflow-related issues</p>
                    <p><strong>Safety warning:</strong> Don't use sharp objects to chip ice - you can puncture refrigerant lines.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Test the Evaporator Fan</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Fan motor failure is the #1 cause. Testing takes 2 minutes.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open freezer door and listen for fan noise (fan stops when door opens on most models)</li>
                        <li>Press door switch (small button on door frame) with door open</li>
                        <li>Fan should start running when switch is pressed</li>
                        <li>Fan should be quiet and smooth (no grinding or squealing)</li>
                        <li>Locate fan behind back panel inside freezer (if accessible)</li>
                        <li>Check if fan blades spin freely by hand (unplug first!)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $0 (DIY test), 5 minutes</p>
                    <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> Identifies problem 90% of time if fan is faulty</p>
                    <p><strong>Safety warning:</strong> Unplug refrigerator before touching any internal components.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="diy-step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Manual Defrost to Remove Ice Buildup</h3>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Ice on evaporator coils blocks airflow. Defrosting can restore cooling temporarily.</p>
                    <p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Remove all food (use coolers with ice packs)</li>
                        <li>Unplug refrigerator completely</li>
                        <li>Open both freezer and fridge doors</li>
                        <li>Place towels on floor to catch water</li>
                        <li>Let defrost naturally for 8-12 hours (never use heat gun - fire hazard)</li>
                        <li>Speed up with fans blowing room-temperature air</li>
                        <li>Wipe all surfaces dry</li>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why is my freezer not freezing but the fridge is cold?</h3>
                    <p>When your freezer isn't freezing but the fridge works, it usually indicates a problem with the evaporator fan (35% of cases), defrost system malfunction (30%), or blocked air vents (20%). The refrigerator section receives cold air first, so freezer-specific issues affect only the freezer compartment. Check if the evaporator fan is running when you open the freezer door - it should stop when opened. If you don't hear any fan noise when door is closed, the fan motor likely failed. Most Toronto homes experience this issue during winter when people overstock freezers, blocking air vents.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does it cost to fix a freezer that's not freezing in Toronto?</h3>
                    <p>Freezer repair costs in Toronto range from $120 for simple fixes like defrost timer replacement to $350+ for evaporator fan motor or defrost heater issues. Diagnostic fee: $80-$100 (waived with repair). Most common repairs fall between $150-$280. Same-day service available from Nika Appliance Repair covering all Toronto and GTA areas including North York, Scarborough, Etobicoke, Mississauga, Brampton, and Vaughan. Cost is significantly lower than replacing a refrigerator ($1,200-$3,000), making repair the economical choice for units under 8 years old.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can a freezer stop working while the fridge still works?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, a freezer can stop working independently because refrigerators use a single cooling system with air circulation controlled by fans and dampers. The evaporator coils are typically in the freezer, and cold air is circulated to the fridge. If the evaporator fan fails, air vent gets blocked, or the defrost system malfunctions, the freezer won't freeze while the residual cold air keeps the fridge somewhat cool. This is actually a common problem - about 25% of refrigerator repair calls in Toronto involve a freezer that won't freeze while the fridge works. Samsung and LG french-door models (2015-2020) are particularly prone to this issue.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to fix a freezer not freezing?</h3>
                    <p>Most freezer repairs take 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the issue. Defrost timer or thermostat replacement: 30-45 minutes. Evaporator fan motor replacement: 1-1.5 hours. Defrost heater replacement: 1.5-2 hours. After repair, the freezer needs 4-6 hours to reach proper temperature (0¬∞F or -18¬∞C) and 24 hours to fully stabilize. Don't put food back until temperature reaches 10¬∞F or below. Keep frozen food in coolers with ice during repair. For Toronto area residents, Nika Appliance Repair offers same-day service - we can typically arrive within 2-4 hours of your call.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I repair or replace a freezer that's not freezing?</h3>
                    <p>Repair your freezer if it's under 8 years old, a quality brand (Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, GE, Bosch), and repair costs under $300. Replace if the unit is over 10 years old, requires compressor replacement ($500+), or has had multiple repairs in past 2 years. Most freezer-not-freezing issues are affordable repairs ($120-$280) worth fixing, especially for newer appliances. Calculate this way: if repair cost is less than 50% of replacement cost AND unit is less than 60% through expected lifespan (12-15 years), repair is better choice. For Toronto residents, keep in mind new refrigerator delivery can take 2-4 weeks, while repair is same-day.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What temperature should a freezer be at?</h3>
                    <p>A freezer should maintain 0¬∞F (-18¬∞C) for optimal food preservation and safety. Temperatures above 10¬∞F (-12¬∞C) allow bacterial growth and food spoilage. Use a freezer thermometer to check - place it between frozen items for 2-3 hours. If temperature is above 10¬∞F, your freezer isn't working properly and needs immediate attention to prevent food loss. In Toronto's climate, a properly working freezer should easily maintain 0¬∞F even in summer. If you notice ice cream becoming soft, ice cubes turning to slush, or frost melting on frozen items, your temperature is too high and requires professional diagnosis within 24 hours to prevent complete food spoilage.</p>
