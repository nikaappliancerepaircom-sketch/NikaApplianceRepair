<p>For over 115 years, Maytag has built a reputation on the slogan "Built to Last" - and their washers and dryers live up to that promise. With 8% market share in Toronto, approximately 104,000 GTA households trust Maytag laundry appliances for their reliability and durability. When your Maytag washer or dryer needs repair, you want technicians who understand the brand's robust engineering and can properly service the heavy-duty components that make these appliances legendary.</p>

                <p>At Nika Appliance Repair, we've serviced over 5,400 Maytag washers and dryers across Toronto since 2017. Our technicians specialize in Maytag's unique transmission systems, powerful motors, and matched pair functionality. Whether you own a classic Maytag top-loader with its iconic transmission, a modern Maytag front-load washer with advanced features, or a coordinated washer-dryer set, we provide expert diagnosis and repair with a comprehensive 90-day warranty.</p>

                <h2 id="maytag-reputation">Why Maytag Dominates the Durability Category</h2>

                <p>Maytag earned its "Dependability" reputation through engineering choices that prioritize longevity over fancy features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commercial-grade components:</strong> Maytag uses heavier transmissions, more powerful motors, and thicker drums than competitors, extending lifespan to 14-16 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Top-loader dominance:</strong> Maytag's top-load washers with agitators remain popular in Toronto for superior cleaning power on heavily soiled work clothes</li>
                    <li><strong>Simplified design:</strong> Fewer electronic features mean fewer points of failure - Maytag focuses on mechanical reliability over digital complexity</li>
                    <li><strong>Repairable construction:</strong> Unlike sealed competitors, Maytag appliances are designed for disassembly and component replacement</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong warranty support:</strong> Maytag backs their "Built to Last" claim with industry-leading warranty coverage, including 10-year limited parts warranties on select components</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Maytag washer and dryer pairs purchased together from the same retailer on the same day often qualify for extended warranty packages at significant discounts. Many Toronto appliance stores offer "bundle protection" adding 3-5 years of coverage for just $150-250 beyond the manufacturer warranty.
                </div>

                <h2 id="common-problems">Most Common Maytag Washer and Dryer Problems</h2>

                <p>Based on our 5,400+ Maytag laundry appliance repairs in Toronto, here are the most frequent issues we encounter:</p>

                <h3>Maytag Washer Transmission Problems (35% of Service Calls)</h3>

                <p>Maytag's robust direct-drive transmission is both their greatest strength and most common repair need:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transmission bearing wear:</strong> After 10-12 years of heavy use, transmission bearings develop play, causing noise and vibration during spin ($320-$450 for transmission replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Oil seal leakage:</strong> Transmission oil seals fail over time, especially in Toronto's temperature extremes, leaking oil onto the floor below the washer ($280-$380 repair)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mode shifter failure:</strong> The actuator mechanism that switches between agitate and spin modes can break, leaving the washer stuck in one mode ($220-$290 replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Input shaft damage:</strong> The shaft connecting the motor to transmission can develop wear, causing slippage and grinding noises ($240-$330 repair)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Understanding Maytag Transmission Longevity</h3>
                    <p>Maytag transmissions last longer than competitors when properly maintained:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Average lifespan:</strong> 12-14 years with normal use (8-10 loads per week)</li>
                        <li><strong>Heavy use scenario:</strong> 8-10 years with 15+ loads per week (large families, home daycare)</li>
                        <li><strong>Load balance critical:</strong> Consistently unbalanced loads reduce transmission life by 30-40% due to increased stress</li>
                        <li><strong>Overloading impact:</strong> Exceeding capacity reduces lifespan by 3-5 years as transmission works harder than designed</li>
                        <li><strong>When to replace vs repair:</strong> If washer is under 8 years old, transmission replacement makes financial sense; over 12 years, consider full unit replacement</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Maytag Dryer Motor and Belt Issues (25% of Calls)</h3>

                <p>Maytag dryers use powerful motors that rarely fail, but supporting components require periodic replacement:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drive belt wear:</strong> The rubber belt connecting motor to drum wears out every 8-10 years, causing drum rotation failure ($165-$210 replacement including idler pulley)</li>
                    <li><strong>Drum roller bearing failure:</strong> Front and rear drum support rollers develop flat spots or bearing wear, causing rhythmic thumping sounds ($190-$255 for all rollers)</li>
                    <li><strong>Blower wheel obstruction:</strong> Lint accumulation in the blower wheel reduces airflow and overheats the motor, causing thermal shutoff ($145-$195 cleaning and part replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Motor mount wear:</strong> Rubber motor mounts deteriorate over time, causing excessive vibration and noise ($140-$180 replacement)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maytag Washer Clutch Assembly Failures (18% of Calls)</h3>

                <p>The clutch mechanism that engages the spin basket is a wear item on Maytag top-loaders:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clutch pad wear:</strong> Friction pads in the clutch assembly wear thin, causing slow spin speed or failure to spin at all ($220-$310 for complete clutch replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Spring tension loss:</strong> Springs that apply pressure to clutch pads weaken over time, reducing spin effectiveness ($195-$265 repair)</li>
                    <li><strong>Carrier assembly damage:</strong> The mechanical components that hold clutch pads can crack or break from stress ($240-$330 for assembly replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Coupling failure:</strong> The drive coupling between motor and transmission can strip, preventing any drum movement ($145-$190 quick fix)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Maytag clutch assemblies give early warning signs before complete failure. Listen for a loud grinding sound during the transition from wash to spin, or observe if spin speed gradually decreases over several months. Addressing clutch wear early prevents secondary damage to the transmission that doubles repair costs.

                <h3>Maytag Lid Switch and Door Lock Problems (12% of Calls)</h3>

                <p>Safety switches that prevent operation with open lids/doors are common failure points:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lid switch mechanical wear:</strong> The plastic actuator that triggers the lid switch breaks from repeated use, preventing wash cycles from starting ($140-$180 replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Door lock assembly failure:</strong> Front-load Maytag washers use electronic door locks that can fail, leaving door locked or unlocked improperly ($185-$245 for lock mechanism)</li>
                    <li><strong>Wiring connection corrosion:</strong> Toronto's humidity causes wire terminal corrosion on safety switches, causing intermittent operation ($155-$205 to repair wiring and replace switch)</li>
                    <li><strong>Striker plate misalignment:</strong> The metal plate the lid/door latches onto can bend or shift, preventing proper switch engagement ($125-$165 adjustment or replacement)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Maytag Dryer Heating Element and Thermal Fuse Failures (10% of Calls)</h3>

                <p>Dryer heating components experience thermal stress that causes gradual degradation:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heating element burnout:</strong> Electric dryer heating elements develop hot spots and break after 10-12 years, causing no heat ($180-$240 element replacement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermal fuse failure:</strong> Safety fuses blow when exhaust restriction causes overheating, cutting power to heating element ($145-$195 repair including fuse and cause correction)</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermostat cycling issues:</strong> Operating thermostats that regulate temperature can fail, causing overheating or insufficient heat ($155-$205 for high-limit and cycling thermostat set)</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas valve solenoid failure:</strong> Gas dryers use electromagnetic coils to open gas valves; these fail preventing ignition ($195-$265 for coil replacement)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Toronto Climate Impact on Maytag Dryers</h3>
                    <p>Toronto's winter temperatures create specific challenges for Maytag dryers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exterior vent icing:</strong> Dryer exhaust condensation freezes in vent hood, blocking airflow and triggering thermal shutoff. Check weekly during sub-zero weather.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lint moisture accumulation:</strong> Cold exterior venting causes moisture to condense before exiting, creating sticky lint buildup that's harder to remove than dry lint.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extended dry times:</strong> Bringing in -10°C air requires more energy to heat than +20°C summer air, extending dry cycles by 10-15 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Install insulated dryer vent pipe ($40-60) and use periscope-style vent boxes behind dryer ($25-35) to minimize condensation zones.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 id="paired-benefits">Benefits of Keeping Maytag Washer-Dryer Pairs Together</h2>

                <p>Many Toronto homeowners purchase Maytag washers and dryers as matched pairs, and there are practical reasons to keep them together:</p>

                <h3>Why Matched Pairs Make Sense</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Capacity coordination:</strong> Paired units have matched drum capacities, ensuring what fits in the washer will dry properly without overloading</li>
                    <li><strong>Aesthetic consistency:</strong> Matching finishes and control panel designs create a professional laundry room appearance</li>
                    <li><strong>Stackable options:</strong> Maytag washer-dryer stacks require factory-matched units with proper mounting hardware ($80-120 stacking kit)</li>
                    <li><strong>Warranty alignment:</strong> Purchasing together extends warranty coverage expiration dates to the same timeline, simplifying protection</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency optimization:</strong> Paired units use coordinated water extraction in the washer to reduce dryer run time by 15-20%</li>
                    <li><strong>Service efficiency:</strong> Technicians can inspect and maintain both units during single service calls, saving your time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>When to Replace vs. Repair in Matched Pairs</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Both units older than 12 years:</strong> When one fails, consider replacing both to maintain matching set and avoid repeat service calls</li>
                    <li><strong>Significant age difference:</strong> If units are 5+ years apart in age, repair the newer unit and plan for eventual pair replacement</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy efficiency gains:</strong> New Maytag pairs use 25-35% less energy and water than 2005-2010 models, potentially offsetting replacement cost</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology gaps:</strong> Modern Maytag pairs offer cycle coordination, smart features, and improved ergonomics worth considering</li>
                    <li><strong>Single unit under 8 years:</strong> Always repair individual units under 8 years old unless multiple catastrophic failures occur</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="maintenance">Maytag Washer and Dryer Maintenance for Toronto Homes</h2>

                <p>Maytag appliances are built to last, but Toronto's climate and water quality require specific maintenance attention:</p>

                <h3>Monthly Maintenance Routine (20 minutes total)</h3>

                <h4>Washer Monthly Tasks:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Run cleaning cycle:</strong> Use Maytag-recommended washer cleaner tablets ($12 for 3-month supply) or 2 cups white vinegar on hot cycle</li>
                    <li><strong>Wipe door seal:</strong> Clean rubber gasket with 1:10 bleach solution to prevent mold growth in Toronto's humid summers</li>
                    <li><strong>Check hose connections:</strong> Inspect supply hoses for bulges, cracks, or moisture around connections</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean dispenser:</strong> Remove and scrub detergent, bleach, and softener dispensers to prevent buildup and odors</li>
                    <li><strong>Leave door open:</strong> After final load, prop door open for 24 hours to air-dry interior and prevent mildew</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Dryer Monthly Tasks:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deep-clean lint screen:</strong> Wash screen with hot soapy water monthly to remove fabric softener film that reduces airflow</li>
                    <li><strong>Vacuum lint chute:</strong> Remove screen and vacuum the chute opening to extract accumulated lint below the screen</li>
                    <li><strong>Check exterior vent:</strong> Verify exterior vent hood flap opens freely and is not blocked by lint, ice, or bird nests</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect drum seals:</strong> Look for wear on door gasket and replace if cracked or torn ($45-65 for gasket kit)</li>
                    <li><strong>Test moisture sensor:</strong> Run sensor cycle to ensure automatic shutoff functions properly (saves energy)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Quarterly Maintenance (60 minutes every 3 months)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clean washer filter:</strong> If your Maytag washer has an accessible drain pump filter, remove and clean debris ($0, prevents pump failure)</li>
                    <li><strong>Descale washer:</strong> Toronto's 6-7 grain hard water requires quarterly descaling with citric acid or commercial descaler ($8-12)</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect washer hoses:</strong> Replace hoses every 5 years regardless of appearance; steel-braided hoses recommended ($35 per pair)</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean full dryer duct:</strong> Disconnect duct from dryer and wall, vacuum entire length, and clean with specialized duct brush ($30 brush kit)</li>
                    <li><strong>Vacuum washer/dryer coils:</strong> Pull units forward and vacuum dust from exterior surfaces and airflow areas</li>
                    <li><strong>Check leveling:</strong> Verify both units remain level; adjust feet as needed to prevent vibration and premature bearing wear</li>
                    <li><strong>Lubricate moving parts:</strong> Apply appliance-safe lubricant to door hinges and moving mechanical components</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Annual Professional Maintenance ($150-220 for both units)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complete diagnostic check:</strong> Test all electronic systems, sensors, and control boards with professional equipment</li>
                    <li><strong>Drive system inspection:</strong> Check washer transmission oil level, clutch condition, and belt tension</li>
                    <li><strong>Dryer airflow test:</strong> Measure actual CFM airflow to verify vent system provides adequate exhaust (300+ CFM optimal)</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrical connection check:</strong> Verify all connections are tight, not showing heat damage, and delivering proper voltage</li>
                    <li><strong>Preventive part replacement:</strong> Replace wear items before failure (belts showing cracks, hoses past 5 years, deteriorating gaskets)</li>
                    <li><strong>Calibration verification:</strong> Test water levels, temperature accuracy, and timer calibration</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety system test:</strong> Verify all safety switches, thermal fuses, and lid/door locks function properly</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Hard Water Protection for Maytag Washers</h3>
                    <p>Toronto's hard water (6-7 grains per gallon) significantly impacts Maytag washers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Mineral buildup locations:</strong> Water inlet valves, drum basket, tub, and internal hoses all accumulate calcium/magnesium deposits</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency loss:</strong> Hard water reduces detergent effectiveness by 30-40%, requiring higher water temperatures and longer cycles</li>
                        <li><strong>Component failure acceleration:</strong> Water valves fail 3-4 years earlier in hard water (6-7 years vs. 10-12 years in soft water)</li>
                        <li><strong>Best solution:</strong> Install whole-home water softener ($800-1,500) to extend all appliance lifespans by 40-60%</li>
                        <li><strong>Budget solution:</strong> Use monthly descaling treatments ($10-20) and clean water inlet screens quarterly</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <li><strong>In-home service:</strong> Maytag warranty includes in-home repair, not depot/carry-in service like budget brands</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Warranty Exclusions</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Labor not covered after year 1:</strong> Extended parts warranty doesn't include labor costs (typically $150-280 depending on repair)</li>
                    <li><strong>Commercial use voids warranty:</strong> Using residential Maytag in commercial settings (laundromats, rentals, Airbnb) nullifies all coverage</li>
                    <li><strong>Installation problems excluded:</strong> Improper electrical, plumbing, or venting issues that cause failures aren't covered</li>
                    <li><strong>Unauthorized service voids coverage:</strong> DIY repairs or non-authorized technicians void remaining manufacturer warranty</li>
                    <li><strong>Cosmetic damage not covered:</strong> Scratches, dents, rust, or discoloration from normal use aren't warranty items</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumable parts excluded:</strong> Filters, hoses, lint screens, and normal wear items aren't covered</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Pair protection plans:</strong> Washer-dryer pairs often qualify for bundled extended warranty discounts (20-30% savings)</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit card coverage:</strong> Some premium credit cards double manufacturer warranty up to 1 additional year (check cardholder agreement)</li>
                    <li><strong>Worth the cost?:</strong> For Maytag appliances, extended warranties rarely pay off due to brand's reliability - save money instead</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="repair-vs-replace">When to Repair vs. Replace Your Maytag Appliances</h2>

                <p>Maytag's durability means repair often makes financial sense longer than for other brands:</p>

                <h3>Clear "Repair" Scenarios</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Under 8 years old:</strong> Maytag appliances under 8 years should almost always be repaired regardless of issue</li>
                    <li><strong>Single component failure:</strong> Issues like belts, switches, or even clutches on otherwise healthy units are cost-effective repairs</li>
                    <li><strong>Repair cost under $300:</strong> For Maytag units 8-12 years old, repairs under $300 typically provide 4-6 additional years of service</li>
                    <li><strong>Recently purchased parts:</strong> If you've recently replaced other components, repair maintains your investment</li>
                    <li><strong>Matched pair consideration:</strong> If washer fails but dryer is perfect, repair washer to maintain matching set</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Clear "Replace" Scenarios</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multiple simultaneous failures:</strong> When 2-3 major systems fail at once, replacement is more economical</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission failure after 12 years:</strong> $320-450 transmission replacement on 12+ year old washer isn't cost-effective</li>
                    <li><strong>Both paired units over 14 years:</strong> When one fails in an old matched pair, replace both for consistency</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeated repairs:</strong> If you've spent $500+ on repairs in past 2 years, replacement prevents ongoing costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency upgrade value:</strong> New Maytag pairs use 30-40% less water/energy, saving $80-140 annually</li>
                    <li><strong>Frame or cabinet rust:</strong> Structural deterioration indicates end-of-life regardless of mechanical condition</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Expected Maytag Lifespans in Toronto</h3>
                    <p>Based on our 5,400+ service calls in Toronto's conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Maytag Top-Load Washers:</strong> 14-16 years (legendary durability, especially commercial-grade models)</li>
                        <li><strong>Maytag Front-Load Washers:</strong> 11-13 years (door seals need replacement at 7-9 years, $180-240)</li>
                        <li><strong>Maytag Electric Dryers:</strong> 14-16 years (simple heating element design maximizes longevity)</li>
                        <li><strong>Maytag Gas Dryers:</strong> 16-18 years (gas systems outlast electric with proper maintenance)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Toronto's hard water reduces washer lifespan by 2-3 years without water softener or regular descaling.</p>

                <div class="faq-section">
                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How much does Maytag washer and dryer repair cost in Toronto?</h3>
                        <p>Maytag repair costs in Toronto range from $140-$500 depending on the issue and appliance. Basic repairs like lid switches or belts average $140-$210, while major work like transmission or motor replacement costs $280-$450. Our diagnostic fee is $95 but is waived when you proceed with repairs. All work includes a 90-day parts and labor warranty.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What are the most common Maytag washer problems?</h3>
                        <p>The most common Maytag washer problems are transmission failures (35% of our calls), clutch assembly wear (18%), lid switch issues (12%), and water inlet valve problems (10%). Maytag's commercial-grade construction means most failures occur after 8-10 years of heavy use rather than premature breakdowns. Toronto's hard water accelerates water valve and pump failures by 2-3 years.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why is my Maytag washer not spinning?</h3>
                        <p>Maytag washers that won't spin typically have clutch assembly failure, broken motor coupling, worn transmission, or lid switch problems. The clutch is the most common cause - friction pads wear out after 10-12 years causing slow spin or no spin at all. Repair costs range from $145 (coupling) to $310 (clutch) to $450 (transmission). Our technicians diagnose the exact cause during the $95 service call.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long do Maytag washers and dryers last?</h3>
                        <p>Maytag washers last 14-16 years (top-load) or 11-13 years (front-load) with proper maintenance, while dryers last 14-18 years depending on fuel type (gas lasts longer). This exceeds industry averages by 3-5 years due to Maytag's commercial-grade components. Toronto's hard water can reduce washer lifespan by 2-3 years without water softener treatment or regular descaling.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I repair or replace my 10-year-old Maytag washer?</h3>
                        <p>For a 10-year-old Maytag washer, repair usually makes sense if the cost is under $350 and only one system has failed. Maytag washers routinely last 14-16 years, so a $250-300 repair provides 4-6 more years of service. However, if the transmission fails ($320-450 repair) and other components show wear, or if you've spent $500+ on repairs in the past 2 years, replacement is more economical.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why is my Maytag dryer not heating?</h3>
                        <p>Maytag dryers that won't heat typically have a burned-out heating element (electric), failed thermal fuse, bad operating thermostat, or gas valve solenoid failure (gas models). The thermal fuse is designed to blow when exhaust restriction causes overheating - this is a $145-195 repair that includes correcting the root cause (usually lint buildup). Heating element replacement costs $180-240.</p>

                        <h3>Do you offer same-day Maytag repair service?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we provide same-day Maytag repair service 7 days a week across Toronto and the GTA.

                        <h3>Can I repair my Maytag appliance myself?</h3>
                        <p>Simple Maytag maintenance like cleaning lint screens, leveling feet, and washing door seals can be done DIY. However, internal repairs like transmission work, motor replacement, clutch assembly, or electrical repairs require professional tools, expertise, and safety equipment. DIY attempts on covered components void your manufacturer warranty and can cause additional damage that increases repair costs by 40-60%.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What's included in your 90-day warranty?</h3>
                        <p>Our 90-day warranty covers all parts and labor for the specific repair performed. If the same issue recurs within 90 days, we return at no charge to fix it properly. This includes any genuine Maytag OEM parts installed and all labor costs. The warranty is transferable if you sell your home and protects against both part defects and workmanship issues.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Why is my Maytag washer leaking?</h3>
                        <p>Maytag washers leak from several common sources: worn door seal/gasket (front-loaders), loose or cracked hoses, failed water inlet valve, damaged tub seal, or transmission oil seal leak. Top-load Maytag transmission oil leaks are distinctive - dark oil on the floor indicates seal failure requiring transmission replacement ($320-450). Door seal leaks are $180-240 to repair. Our technicians pinpoint the exact source during diagnosis.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Does hard water damage Maytag appliances?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, Toronto's moderately hard water (6-7 grains per gallon) significantly impacts Maytag washers. Water inlet valves fail 2-3 years earlier (7-8 years instead of 10-12), detergent effectiveness drops 30-40% requiring hotter water, and internal components accumulate mineral scale. Solutions include whole-home water softeners ($800-1,500), monthly descaling treatments ($10-20), or quarterly cleaning of inlet screens.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I replace both if one fails in a matched pair?</h3>
                        <p>For Maytag matched pairs, replace both only if both units are over 12 years old and the repair cost exceeds $350. If one unit is significantly newer or in excellent condition, repair the failed unit to maintain your matched set. Consider that new pairs offer 30-40% energy savings, but this takes 8-10 years to offset replacement cost of a working unit.</p>
