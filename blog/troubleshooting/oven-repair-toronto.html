                <h2>Gas Oven Problems: Understanding the Most Common Issues</h2>
                <p>Gas ovens account for a significant portion of our repair calls in Toronto. These efficient, responsive cooking appliances have been kitchen staples for decades, but they're subject to specific failure modes that require expert diagnosis. Unlike electric ovens, gas units involve combustion, ignition systems, and gas valve controls that demand precision repair work.</p>

                <h3>Igniter Not Sparking (50% of Gas Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>The most frequent problem we encounter is a faulty igniter. Modern gas ovens use electric igniters to create a spark that ignites the gas. When this fails, your oven simply won't light. You might see gas flowing (indicated by smell) but no flame, which is both frustrating and potentially dangerous. The igniter is a ceramic or metal component that develops resistance over time and eventually burns out. This typically happens after 10-15 years of regular use.</p>
                <p>Replacement igniters for gas ovens generally cost between $250 and $350 in parts and labor. The repair is relatively straightforward for certified technicians but should never be attempted at home. Gas igniter repairs require proper tools, safety knowledge, and certification to ensure the oven operates safely afterward.</p>

                <h3>Oven Temperature Inconsistent (30% of Gas Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>If your gas oven heats unevenly, takes forever to preheat, or won't maintain the temperature you've set, the thermostat or temperature sensor is likely failing. This creates frustrating cooking situations where baked goods brown unevenly, roasted vegetables burn on one side while staying raw on the other, or cookies spread before setting properly. The issue stems from the gas valve not responding correctly to temperature fluctuations.</p>
                <p>Gas oven thermostats typically cost $200-$350 to replace when you factor in parts and professional labor. This is a critical repair because an oven that can't maintain temperature compromises food safety and quality. We always test thermostats thoroughly after replacement to ensure accurate temperature readings at all settings.</p>

                <h3>Pilot Light Issues in Older Models (20% of Gas Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>Older gas ovens in Toronto often have pilot lights—small, continuous flames that ignite the main burner when needed. While older technology, these systems are reliable once properly adjusted. Pilot light problems include difficulty staying lit, excessive sooting around the opening, or flames that are too yellow (indicating incomplete combustion). These issues arise from clogged pilot ports, dirty jets, or misaligned burners.</p>
                <p>Pilot light repairs typically cost less than $150 because they involve cleaning and adjustment rather than component replacement. However, diagnosing the root cause of pilot light problems requires experience. We've seen cases where homeowners spent money on part replacements when simple cleaning would have solved the problem.</p>

                <div class="safety-warning">
                    <h4>⚠️ Gas Safety Warning</h4>
                    <p>Never attempt to repair a gas oven yourself. Gas is inherently dangerous, and improper repairs can lead to gas leaks, incomplete combustion, or carbon monoxide production. Always contact a certified technician. In Toronto, TSSA (Technical Safety Standards Authority) certification is not just recommended—it's legally required for gas appliance work.</p>

            <!-- Electric Oven Problems Section -->
            <section class="section electric">
                <h2>Electric Oven Problems: Common Failures and Solutions</h2>
                <p>Electric ovens represent a different set of repair challenges. Without combustion and ignition systems, electric ovens fail in predictable ways that are often easier to diagnose. The heating element, thermostat, and control board are the primary components that wear out over time. Toronto homeowners often prefer electric ovens for their even heat distribution and precise temperature control, making failures particularly noticeable.</p>

                <h3>Heating Element Failure (40% of Electric Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>The heating element is essentially a large resistor that converts electricity into heat. These components typically last 8-15 years depending on usage frequency and quality. When a heating element fails, your oven simply won't heat. You might see partial heating (indicating a broken element that's still partially conducting) or complete failure. Some homeowners notice the element glowing red initially, then gradually losing brightness until it no longer heats at all.</p>
                <p>Electric heating element replacement costs between $150 and $300 including parts and labor. This is one of the most straightforward repairs we perform. The element itself is inexpensive (often $30-$80), but removal and reinstallation require proper tools and electrical safety knowledge. Many electric ovens have upper and lower elements, so if one fails, the other is likely to follow within months.</p>

                <h3>Thermostat and Temperature Control Issues (30% of Electric Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>Electric ovens rely on sophisticated thermostat systems to maintain consistent temperatures. When the thermostat fails, you get temperature swings—the oven might overshoot the target temperature, then cool down too much before heating again. This creates hot spots and cold spots in your baked goods. Some ovens with digital thermostats display error codes when the temperature sensor fails, providing helpful diagnostic information.</p>
                <p>Thermostat replacement typically costs $200-$350 for parts and labor. Modern electric ovens often use more complex temperature sensing systems than older models, which can increase repair costs. We've found that genuine manufacturer parts provide better accuracy than aftermarket alternatives, even though they cost slightly more upfront.</p>

                <h3>Control Board Problems (15% of Electric Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>Modern electric ovens contain control boards (circuit boards) that manage heating elements, temperature sensing, timing, and safety functions. When these boards fail, you might experience random shutdowns, inability to set temperatures, unresponsive buttons, or continuous heating without shutoff. Control board failures are more common in newer ovens with digital displays and smart features.</p>
                <p>Control board replacement is the most expensive electric oven repair, typically ranging from $300-$600 including parts and labor. Some Toronto appliance repair services attempt board-level repairs (fixing specific components on the board), but we often recommend replacement for reliability. Repaired boards can fail again shortly after repair, whereas new boards come with a warranty.</p>

                <h3>Door Latch and Gasket Issues (10% of Electric Oven Repairs)</h3>
                <p>The oven door has a gasket (seal) and latch mechanism. When these fail, heat escapes, affecting cooking performance and energy efficiency. A faulty seal can increase energy consumption by 10-15% and make the oven impossible to clean properly. Door latches sometimes break from repeated slamming or wear, preventing the door from closing completely or creating strange rattling sounds during operation.</p>
                <p>Door gasket replacement costs $100-$200, while door latch repairs typically run $150-$250. These repairs are often overlooked but can significantly improve oven performance once completed. We recommend replacing both the gasket and any worn latch components simultaneously, as doing one repair often reveals problems with the other.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <strong>Electricity Safety Note:</strong> Electric ovens contain high-voltage components. Always ensure the circuit breaker is off before any service work. Never attempt internal repairs if you're not properly trained in electrical safety.

            <!-- Safety and Certification Section -->
            <section class="section safety">
                <h2>Safety & Certification: Why TSSA Matters</h2>
                <p>In Toronto and throughout Ontario, the Technical Safety Standards Authority (TSSA) regulates all work involving gas appliances. This isn't just bureaucratic red tape—it's a critical safety requirement that protects your family from serious hazards. When you hire someone without proper TSSA certification to work on your gas oven, you're exposing yourself to dangerous risks.</p>

                <h3>TSSA Certification Requirements</h3>
                <p>TSSA-certified technicians complete extensive training covering gas safety, combustion principles, pressure testing, leak detection, and proper installation procedures. Certification requires documented experience, passing examinations, and continuing education. When we perform gas oven repairs, we're not just fixing an appliance—we're ensuring your home meets Ontario's safety standards.</p>
                <p>The certification also protects you legally. If an uncertified person works on your gas oven and something goes wrong, your insurance might deny claims. More importantly, you could face liability issues if the improper repair causes injury or property damage.</p>

                <h3>Carbon Monoxide Concerns</h3>
                <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is the silent killer. Gas ovens are potential CO sources if they malfunction or are improperly repaired. Carbon monoxide has no smell, color, or taste. Exposure symptoms include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and vomiting—symptoms often mistaken for flu. Prolonged exposure can cause death.</p>
                <p>A properly functioning gas oven produces minimal carbon monoxide and vents it safely outside. An improperly repaired oven or one with a faulty valve can produce dangerous levels of CO that accumulate in your home. Every gas oven repair we complete includes CO testing to ensure safety. We use calibrated gas detection equipment to verify that your oven is producing normal combustion byproducts and venting them correctly.</p>

                <h3>Why Professional Gas Repair is Non-Negotiable</h3>
                <p>We recommend against DIY gas oven repair for several critical reasons. First, gas work requires specialized knowledge that takes years to develop. Second, improper repairs compromise safety in ways that aren't immediately obvious. Third, using uncertified technicians can void warranties and create liability issues. Fourth, the cost difference between DIY disaster recovery and professional repair makes hiring certified technicians the smart financial choice.</p>
                <p>Over our years serving Toronto, we've encountered ovens damaged by previous DIY attempts—damage that cost customers significantly more to repair than the original problem would have. Don't let that be your story. Contact a TSSA-certified professional the first time something goes wrong.</p>

                <div class="safety-warning">
                    <h4>⚠️ Critical Safety Requirements</h4>
                    <p>• All gas oven repairs require TSSA-certified technicians in Ontario<br>
                    • Carbon monoxide testing should occur after any gas repair<br>
                    • Never attempt gas pressure adjustments yourself<br>

            <!-- Repair vs Replacement Decision -->
            <section>
                <h2>Repair vs. Replacement: Making the Smart Decision</h2>
                <p>One of the most common questions we hear is: "Should I repair this oven or buy a new one?" The answer depends on several factors including the oven's age, the repair cost, replacement costs, and energy efficiency improvements available in new models. Let's break down the decision-making process.</p>

                <h3>The 50% Rule and Cost Analysis</h3>
                <p>A general rule in appliance repair is the "50% rule": if repair costs exceed 50% of the replacement cost, consider replacement. For ovens, this works reasonably well but requires context. A $400 repair on a $1,200 oven might be justified if the oven is only 5 years old. The same repair on a 15-year-old oven worth $800 at replacement might tip toward buying new.</p>
                <p>Consider the following cost scenario: A heating element replacement costs $200. A comparable new electric oven costs $800-$1,200. The repair is clearly justified. However, if the control board also needs replacement ($400), plus the heating element ($200), plus a thermostat issue ($250), you're approaching $850 in repairs on a 12-year-old oven. That's when replacement makes financial sense.</p>

                <h3>Age and Remaining Lifespan</h3>
                <p>Most ovens last 12-17 years with proper maintenance. Knowing your oven's age helps predict remaining lifespan. If your oven is 14 years old and needs a $300 repair, you're essentially paying to extend a machine that's near the end of its expected life. However, that same repair on a 6-year-old oven suggests you'll get 8+ more years of service.</p>
                <p>Our recommendation: If your oven is under 10 years old and the repair costs less than $400, repair it. If it's between 10-14 years old and repair costs are under $300-$350, repair it. If it's over 15 years old, seriously consider replacement even for moderate-cost repairs, as you're nearing the end of its lifespan regardless.</p>

                <h3>Energy Efficiency and Modern Features</h3>
                <p>New ovens incorporate energy-efficient designs that reduce electricity consumption by 10-15% compared to models from 10+ years ago. Convection features, better insulation, and more precise temperature control mean faster cooking and more consistent results. If you're considering replacement, modern ovens with convection technology, multiple racks, and improved heating distribution justify the investment through both energy savings and enhanced cooking performance.</p>
                <p>Some Toronto homeowners justify oven replacement for lifestyle reasons beyond pure economics. Smart ovens with remote monitoring, precise temperature control, or specialized cooking modes appeal to serious home cooks. If you enjoy cooking and spend significant time preparing meals, upgrading to a new oven represents money well-spent on an appliance you use daily.</p>

                <h3>Financing Options for Replacement</h3>
                <p>If replacement makes sense but upfront cost is a concern, financing options exist. Many appliance retailers offer 0% financing for 12-24 months on purchases over $500. Credit cards with promotional rates can spread costs over time. Some Toronto utility companies offer rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances.</p>
                <p>Factor these options into your decision. A $1,000 oven financed at 0% for 24 months costs about $42/month—often comparable to repair costs spread over a year when you consider all service visits and potential future repairs.</p>

                        <p itemprop="text">It depends on the problem. If your oven won't heat, there's no safety risk in not using it. However, if you have a gas oven with a faulty igniter that's producing gas without igniting, we recommend not using the oven as it could pose safety risks. Call us immediately if you smell gas. Never use an oven you suspect has a gas leak.</p>
