                    <h2>Common Causes of Refrigerator Not Cooling in Toronto Homes</h2>
                    <p>When your refrigerator stops cooling properly, it's more than just an inconvenience—it can lead to hundreds of dollars in spoiled food. In Toronto's climate, with our cold winters and humid summers, refrigerators face unique challenges. Based on 5,200+ repairs we've completed across the GTA, here are the most common causes:</p>

                    <h3>Top 5 Reasons Your Fridge Isn't Cooling:</h3>

                    <ol class="causes-list">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Dirty Condenser Coils</strong> - 70% of cases
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fridge gradually getting warmer, compressor running constantly, high energy bills.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Dust, pet hair, and debris accumulate on the coils over time, preventing heat dissipation. In Toronto homes with forced air heating, this happens faster.</p>
                            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Unplug and vacuum the coils with a brush attachment. Takes 15 minutes.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Faulty Compressor</strong> - 15% of cases
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fridge not cooling at all, clicking or buzzing sounds, compressor hot to touch.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Compressor failure after 8-12 years of use, or sudden power surge damage (common during Toronto thunderstorms).</p>
                            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Requires professional replacement. Cost: $300-$500.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Broken Thermostat</strong> - 10% of cases
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fridge too cold or not cold enough, temperature fluctuations, frost buildup.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Thermostat sensor fails or becomes miscalibrated over time.</p>
                            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Test by adjusting settings. If no change, needs replacement ($120-$200).</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Blocked Air Vents</strong> - 3% of cases
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Freezer works but fridge section warm, ice buildup in freezer.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Overloading the fridge or placing items directly against vents blocks airflow.</p>
                            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Reorganize fridge, clear vents. Immediate fix, costs $0.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Damaged Door Seals</strong> - 2% of cases
                            <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Cool air escaping, condensation on exterior, fridge running constantly.</p>
                            <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Worn gaskets from daily use, torn seals, or warped door from heavy items on door shelves.</p>
                            <p><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Replace door gasket. DIY: $40-$80 in parts, Professional: $120-$180.</p>
                        </li>

                    <h3>Factors Affecting Repair Cost in Toronto:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Brand & Model</strong> - High-end brands (Sub-Zero, Viking, Thermador) have more expensive parts. Budget brands (Danby, Haier) have cheaper but harder-to-find parts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Age of Appliance</strong> - Older units (10+ years) may need discontinued parts that cost more or take longer to source.</li>
                        <li><strong>Type of Refrigerator</strong> - French door and side-by-side models are more complex and costly to repair than top-freezer models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location in GTA</strong> - Service calls outside central Toronto (Vaughan, Milton, Oshawa) may include travel fees ($20-$40).</li>
                        <li><strong>Urgency</strong> - Same-day or after-hours service may include premium fees ($50-$100 extra).</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <h4>💡 Money-Saving Tip:</h4>
                        <p>Get a detailed written quote before authorizing repairs. Ask if the diagnostic fee is waived with repair. At Nika, we always provide upfront pricing and waive diagnostic fees when you proceed with the repair.</p>

But if your 12-year-old budget brand needs a $400 repair and a new one costs $800, replacement makes more sense (50%+ of replacement cost).</p>

                    <h2>Expert Tips from Toronto Technicians</h2>
                    <p>After completing 5,200+ refrigerator repairs across the GTA, our licensed technicians share their top preventive maintenance tips:</p>

                            <h3>💡 Tip 1: Clean Coils Every 6 Months</h3>
                            <p>This is the #1 preventable cause of cooling issues. Set a reminder for March and September to vacuum your condenser coils. In homes with pets, do it quarterly. This simple 15-minute task can extend your fridge's lifespan by 3-5 years and save you $100-$200 yearly in energy costs.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-item">
                            <h3>💡 Tip 2: Don't Overload Your Fridge</h3>
                            <p>Keep your refrigerator at 75% capacity maximum. Overloading blocks air vents and forces the compressor to work harder, leading to premature failure. If you need more space during holidays, consider a temporary beverage fridge rather than cramming everything in.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-item">
                            <h3>💡 Tip 3: Monitor Temperature Weekly</h3>
                            <p>Place a thermometer in your fridge and check it weekly. Ideal temperature is 37°F (3°C). If you notice fluctuations, address the issue immediately—early intervention prevents costly repairs. Toronto's temperature swings (especially during season changes) can affect refrigerator performance.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-item">
                            <h3>💡 Tip 4: Leave Space Around Your Fridge</h3>
                            <p>Maintain at least 1 inch of clearance on all sides for proper ventilation. Built-in fridges need even more space. Poor ventilation causes the compressor to overheat, especially during Toronto's humid summers.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tip-item">
                            <h3>💡 Tip 5: Replace Water Filters on Schedule</h3>
                            <p>If your fridge has a water dispenser or ice maker, replace the filter every 6 months. Clogged filters restrict water flow and can damage the ice maker. Toronto's hard water accelerates filter clogging—some areas need replacement every 4 months.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Recommended Maintenance Schedule:</h3>
                    <ul class="maintenance-schedule">
                        <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Check temperature, wipe spills, organize to prevent vent blocking</li>
                        <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Clean door seals, check for unusual sounds or smells</li>
                        <li><strong>Every 6 Months:</strong> Vacuum condenser coils, replace water filter, check drainage</li>
                        <li><strong>Yearly:</strong> Professional inspection (we offer free inspections with any service call)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="tip-highlight">🌟 <strong>Toronto-Specific Tip:</strong> During winter, watch for ice buildup in the freezer. Dry winter air can cause frost issues. During summer humidity, check door seals more frequently as condensation can weaken them.</p>

                            <p itemprop="text">Refrigerator repair costs in Toronto range from $150-$350 on average. Service call fees are $75-$100, diagnostic fees are $50-$75 (waived with repair), and labor rates are $80-$120 per hour. Common repairs include thermostat replacement ($120-$200) and compressor replacement ($300-$500).</p>

                            <p itemprop="text">If your freezer works but the fridge isn't cooling, the issue is usually a blocked air vent, faulty evaporator fan, or broken damper control. The evaporator fan circulates cold air from the freezer to the fridge. Check if the fan is running and clear any ice buildup blocking the vents.</p>

                            <p itemprop="text">Signs of a bad compressor include: the fridge is not cooling at all, you hear clicking or buzzing sounds, the compressor is hot to touch, or the compressor doesn't run. A compressor should hum quietly. If it's silent or making loud noises, call a technician immediately.</p>

                            <p itemprop="text">Repair a 10-year-old refrigerator if it's a high-end brand (Bosch, Miele, Sub-Zero) and the repair costs less than 50% of a new unit. Replace if it's a budget brand, needs multiple major repairs, or repair costs exceed 60% of replacement cost. Average refrigerator lifespan is 10-15 years.</p>

                            <p itemprop="text">Yes, you can fix simple issues like dirty condenser coils (70% of cases), incorrect temperature settings, or blocked vents. These DIY fixes take 15-30 minutes. However, call a professional for compressor issues, refrigerant leaks, or electrical problems. DIY repairs save $100-$200 in service fees.</p>

                            <p itemprop="text">After cleaning condenser coils, wait 2-4 hours for noticeable cooling improvement. Full temperature stabilization takes 24 hours. If the fridge isn't cooling after 24 hours, the issue is likely not the coils and you should call a professional technician.</p>
