                    <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Your dryer not heating is most commonly caused by a blown thermal fuse (60% of Toronto cases), failed heating element in electric dryers, or gas valve issues in gas models. Thermal fuse replacement costs $150-$200, while heating element replacement runs $200-$300. Gas dryer repairs require TSSA-certified professionals in Ontario and cost $250-$350. Based on our 5,200+ repairs across Toronto, lint buildup from poor vent maintenance causes 75% of thermal fuse failures.

                <p>When your dryer stops heating, wet laundry piles up fast. Whether you have a gas or electric dryer, this comprehensive guide covers everything Toronto homeowners need to know about diagnosing and fixing heating problems. We'll explore the critical differences between gas and electric dryers, common failure points, safety regulations specific to Ontario, and when you can safely DIY versus when you need professional help.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Gas vs Electric Dryer Heating Systems</h2>

                <p>The heating mechanism in your dryer depends entirely on whether you have a gas or electric model. This fundamental difference affects everything from troubleshooting steps to repair costs to legal requirements for service in Ontario.</p>

                <h3>Electric Dryer Heating Components</h3>

                <p>Electric dryers use a heating element - a coiled wire similar to what you'd find in a toaster or space heater. When 240 volts of electricity flow through this element, it heats up to 130-150°F, warming the air that tumbles through your clothes.</p>

                <p><strong>Key components in electric dryer heating systems:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Heating element:</strong> Metal coil that produces heat when electricity flows through it</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermal fuse:</strong> Safety device that cuts power if temperature exceeds 185-190°F</li>
                    <li><strong>Cycling thermostat:</strong> Regulates temperature by cycling the element on and off</li>
                    <li><strong>High-limit thermostat:</strong> Additional safety cutoff at extreme temperatures</li>
                    <li><strong>240V power supply:</strong> Requires both breakers in a double-pole circuit breaker</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Based on our repair data from Toronto homes, heating element failure accounts for 25% of electric dryer heating issues, while thermal fuse failure represents 60% of cases. The remaining 15% involves thermostats, wiring issues, or control board problems.</p>

                <h3>Gas Dryer Heating Components</h3>

                <p>Gas dryers use a burner assembly similar to a furnace or gas water heater. Natural gas or propane ignites to create heat, making them more energy-efficient than electric models but more complex mechanically.</p>

                <p><strong>Key components in gas dryer heating systems:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Igniter:</strong> Glows white-hot to ignite gas (most common failure point)</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas valve coils:</strong> Open to allow gas flow when igniter is hot enough</li>
                    <li><strong>Flame sensor:</strong> Detects flame presence and shuts gas if flame goes out</li>
                    <li><strong>Burner assembly:</strong> Where gas combustion occurs</li>
                    <li><strong>Thermal fuse:</strong> Same safety function as electric dryers</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas supply line:</strong> Delivers natural gas or propane to the dryer</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>Ontario TSSA Gas Regulations - Critical Safety Information</h3>
                    <p>In Ontario, the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) strictly regulates all gas appliance work. Here's what Toronto homeowners must know:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Legal requirement:</strong> Only TSSA-certified gas fitters can legally install, repair, or service gas dryers</li>
                        <li><strong>DIY prohibition:</strong> Homeowner gas appliance work is illegal under Ontario law</li>
                        <li><strong>Insurance implications:</strong> DIY gas work voids home insurance and liability coverage</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety risks:</strong> Gas leaks, carbon monoxide poisoning, fire hazards, explosions</li>
                        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Always verify your technician's TSSA certification before gas work begins</li>
                        <li><strong>Penalties:</strong> Fines up to $50,000 for unlicensed gas work in Ontario</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> Never attempt DIY repairs on gas dryers. The $100-150 you might save is not worth the legal, safety, and insurance risks. Nika Appliance Repair employs only TSSA-certified gas fitters for all gas appliance work.</p>

                <h2>Common Causes: Why Your Dryer Stopped Heating</h2>

                <p>After completing 5,200+ dryer repairs across the Greater Toronto Area, we've identified clear patterns in heating failures. The causes differ significantly between electric and gas models.</p>

                <h3>Thermal Fuse Failure - The #1 Cause in Toronto</h3>

                <p>The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device designed to prevent dryer fires. When temperatures exceed 185-190°F, the fuse "blows" (breaks the circuit), cutting all power to the heating element or gas burner. The dryer will still run and tumble clothes, but no heat is produced.</p>

                <p><strong>Why thermal fuses blow more frequently in Toronto homes:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lint accumulation:</strong> Toronto homes with families generate 2-4 pounds of lint annually, clogging vents faster</li>
                    <li><strong>Long vent runs:</strong> Condos and townhomes often have 15-25 foot vent runs versus 6-10 feet in detached homes</li>
                    <li><strong>Winter icing:</strong> Toronto's cold winters cause ice buildup in exterior vent flaps, restricting airflow</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible plastic vents:</strong> Older Toronto homes may still have non-code-compliant plastic or foil vents that sag and restrict airflow</li>
                    <li><strong>Crushed vents:</strong> Dryers pushed too close to walls crimp the vent hose</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Thermal fuse replacement costs $150-$200 professionally, or $20-$40 if you DIY on an electric dryer. However, simply replacing the fuse without addressing the root cause guarantees it will blow again within weeks or months.</p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip from 5,200+ Repairs:</strong> When we replace a thermal fuse, we always inspect and clean the entire vent system. In Toronto homes, we find the average dryer vent contains 1.5-3 pounds of lint buildup. Complete vent cleaning costs $120-$180 but prevents recurring thermal fuse failures and reduces fire risk by 90%.
                </div>

                <h3>Heating Element Burnout (Electric Dryers)</h3>

                <p>Electric dryer heating elements fail when the coiled wire breaks, develops holes, or burns through. This typically happens gradually over 8-18 years of normal use, though it can fail suddenly.</p>

                <p><strong>Signs your heating element has failed:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Absolutely no heat production (dryer tumbles but air is room temperature)</li>
                    <li>Visual inspection shows breaks, gaps, or holes in the coil</li>
                    <li>Multimeter continuity test shows infinite resistance (should read 10-50 ohms)</li>
                    <li>No warm air even after running for 20-30 minutes</li>
                    <li>Element shows signs of overheating, discoloration, or warping</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Heating element replacement costs $200-$300 professionally in Toronto. The part itself costs $50-$120, with labor adding $150-$180. DIY replacement is possible if you're comfortable working with 240V electrical systems, but you must disconnect power at the breaker first.</p>

                <h3>Gas Igniter Failure (Gas Dryers)</h3>

                <p>Gas dryer igniters have a limited lifespan of 1,000-1,500 heating cycles. When they fail, you'll see the igniter glow orange or red instead of bright white, or it won't glow at all. Without sufficient heat, the gas valve won't open, and no combustion occurs.</p>

                <p><strong>Diagnosing gas igniter problems:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Igniter glows but dryer doesn't heat (weak igniter, insufficient heat to open gas valve)</li>
                    <li>Igniter doesn't glow at all (complete failure or electrical issue)</li>
                    <li>You hear clicking but no ignition (igniter working but gas valve or flame sensor issue)</li>
                    <li>Intermittent heating (igniter failing but not completely dead yet)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Gas igniter replacement costs $250-$350 in Toronto including TSSA-certified labor. This must be performed by licensed professionals - never attempt DIY gas appliance repair in Ontario.</p>

                <h2>DIY vs Professional Repair: Safety & Legal Considerations</h2>

                <p>Understanding when you can safely tackle dryer repairs yourself versus when you need professional help protects your safety, your wallet, and your legal standing.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide</h2>

                <p>Follow this systematic approach to diagnose why your dryer isn't heating. These steps apply to both gas and electric dryers, though gas dryer repairs require professional service.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Verify Basic Operation</h3>

                <p>Before assuming a major component failure, rule out simple issues:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Check if dryer runs:</strong> If it won't start at all, you have a different problem</li>
                    <li><strong>Verify power supply:</strong> Electric dryers need both breakers on in a 240V circuit. Check both breakers in the panel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confirm gas supply (gas dryers):</strong> Ensure the gas shutoff valve near the dryer is fully open</li>
                    <li><strong>Test another cycle:</strong> Sometimes controls glitch; try a different heat setting</li>
                    <li><strong>Check settings:</strong> Ensure you haven't accidentally selected "air dry" or "no heat" cycle</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step 2: Inspect the Thermal Fuse</h3>

                <p>The thermal fuse is the most common failure point, so test this first:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Disconnect power:</strong> Turn off breaker and unplug dryer</li>
                    <li><strong>Access the thermal fuse:</strong> Usually located on the blower housing or near the heat source. Consult your manual.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test for continuity:</strong> Use a multimeter set to ohms. A good fuse shows 0 ohms (continuity). A blown fuse shows infinite resistance (no continuity).</li>
                    <li><strong>Replace if blown:</strong> Install exact replacement part (about $10-$25)</li>
                    <li><strong>Critical - Find the cause:</strong> Clean entire vent system before operating dryer or fuse will blow again</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Toronto Climate Factor:</strong> Winter ice buildup in exterior dryer vents is a major cause of thermal fuse failure in Toronto. Before replacing the fuse, check your exterior vent flap. Ice accumulation restricts airflow, causing overheating. Install a vent hood with better cold-weather performance ($40-$80) to prevent recurrence.
                </div>

                <h3>Step 3: Test the Heating Element (Electric Dryers)</h3>

                <p>If the thermal fuse is good, test the heating element next:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Power disconnected:</strong> Verify dryer is unplugged and breaker is off</li>
                    <li><strong>Access element housing:</strong> Usually behind a rear or front panel (model-specific)</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual inspection:</strong> Look for obvious breaks, holes, or damage in the coil</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuity test:</strong> Element should show 10-50 ohms resistance. Infinite resistance indicates failure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ground test:</strong> Test from element terminal to dryer chassis. Should show infinite resistance. Any continuity indicates element is grounding out.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Heating elements cost $50-$120 depending on model. Installation difficulty varies - some models require removing the drum, which is time-consuming.</p>

                <h3>Step 4: Check Gas Components (Gas Dryers - Professional Only)</h3>

                <p>For gas dryers, you can observe igniter operation to help diagnose the problem, but actual repair requires TSSA-certified professionals:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start dryer on heat cycle</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Observe igniter:</strong> Should glow bright white within 30-60 seconds</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen for gas valve:</strong> You should hear a click when valve opens (if igniter is working properly)</li>
                    <li><strong>Check for flame:</strong> Blue flame should appear within 5-10 seconds of valve opening</li>
                    <li><strong>Note symptoms:</strong> Report what you observed when calling professional service</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Common gas dryer issues requiring professional repair:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Igniter glows orange/red but won't heat: Weak igniter, needs replacement ($250-$350)</li>
                    <li>No igniter glow: Electrical issue or complete igniter failure ($200-$300)</li>
                    <li>Igniter glows but no gas valve click: Gas valve coils failed ($300-$400)</li>
                    <li>Flame ignites then goes out: Flame sensor issue ($250-$350)</li>
                    <li>No gas smell: Gas supply issue, check shutoff valve first (free), may need gas line work ($400+)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 5: Clean the Entire Vent System</h3>

                <p>Regardless of what component failed, thorough vent cleaning is essential:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Disconnect vent hose:</strong> Pull dryer away from wall, disconnect vent at dryer</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean internal ductwork:</strong> Use a dryer vent brush kit (18-24 feet, $30-$50 at Home Depot)</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean exterior vent:</strong> Remove exterior hood, clean flap and opening thoroughly</li>
                    <li><strong>Vacuum everywhere:</strong> Behind dryer, inside vent connections, around drum seals</li>
                    <li><strong>Check for damage:</strong> Replace crushed, kinked, or plastic/foil vents with rigid metal duct</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize vent length:</strong> Shorter runs perform better. Every 90° elbow adds 5 feet equivalent length.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Professional vent cleaning costs $120-$180 in Toronto and should be done annually for fire safety and efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Preventive Maintenance: Keep Your Dryer Heating Efficiently</h2>

                <p>Preventing heating failures costs far less than emergency repairs. Follow this Toronto-specific maintenance program based on our field experience:</p>

                <h3>Maximize Dryer Lifespan in Toronto Climate</h3>

                <p>Toronto's unique climate - cold winters, humid summers, and hard water - accelerates dryer wear. Our preventive maintenance recommendations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Winter preparation:</strong> Inspect exterior vent monthly for ice buildup. Install a vent hood with spring-loaded damper that resists freezing ($40-$80). Clear snow away from vent opening after storms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard water protection:</strong> Toronto water averages 6-7 grains per gallon hardness. While dryers don't use water, lint combines with humidity to create deposits in gas burners. Annual professional cleaning recommended for gas models ($150-$200).</li>
                    <li><strong>Humidity management:</strong> Summer humidity in Toronto averages 65%. Empty lint trap after every load - humid lint compacts more easily, restricting airflow faster.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vent length optimization:</strong> Many Toronto condos and townhomes have 20-35 foot vent runs. Consider installing a vent booster fan ($200-$400 installed) to maintain proper airflow and reduce heating system stress.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Energy Efficiency Tips (Lower Costs & Extend Component Life)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't over-dry:</strong> Excessive heat cycles shorten heating element and gas igniter lifespan. Use moisture sensor cycles instead of timed drying.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean lint between loads:</strong> Restricted airflow makes heating components work harder, shortening lifespan by 30-40%</li>
                    <li><strong>Sort loads properly:</strong> Dry similar fabrics together for optimal heat cycling</li>
                    <li><strong>Adequate ventilation:</strong> Ensure 6+ inches clearance on all sides for proper airflow</li>
                    <li><strong>Check door seal:</strong> Damaged seals allow heat escape, forcing longer cycle times</li>
                    <li><strong>Periodic professional service:</strong> Annual inspection catches small issues before they become expensive failures ($100-$150 checkup vs $200-$400 emergency repair)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Cost Savings from Preventive Maintenance:</strong> Our data from 5,200+ repairs shows Toronto homeowners who follow annual maintenance schedules spend 60% less on dryer repairs over 10 years compared to those who only call when emergencies occur. Annual vent cleaning ($120-$180) + biennial professional inspection ($100-$150) costs $400-$500 per decade versus $800-$1,200+ in emergency repairs for neglected dryers.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Why is my dryer not heating in Toronto?</h3>
                <p>The most common causes are thermal fuse failure (60% of cases in Toronto due to lint buildup), heating element burnout in electric dryers (25%), gas valve issues in gas dryers (10%), and thermostat malfunction (5%). Toronto's climate and hard water can accelerate lint accumulation and component wear.</p>

                <h3>How much does it cost to fix a dryer not heating in Toronto?</h3>
                <p>Thermal fuse replacement costs $150-$200, heating element replacement costs $200-$300, gas valve repair costs $250-$350, and thermostat replacement costs $150-$250. Parts typically cost $50-$150, with labor adding $100-$200 in the Toronto area.</p>

                <h3>What's the difference between gas and electric dryer heating problems?</h3>
                <p>Electric dryers use heating elements that can burn out and require 240V power supply checks. Gas dryers use burners with gas valves, ignitors, and flame sensors, requiring TSSA-certified technicians for safety and Ontario legal compliance. Gas dryers are more complex but often cheaper to operate.</p>

                <h3>Can I replace a thermal fuse myself or do I need a professional?</h3>
                <p>Electric dryer thermal fuse replacement is safe for DIY if you disconnect power first, follow manufacturer instructions, and clean the vent thoroughly to prevent recurrence. Gas dryer work requires TSSA-certified professionals in Ontario - DIY gas work is illegal and dangerous. Cost savings: DIY $20-$40 for parts vs professional $150-$200.</p>

                <h3>Why does my thermal fuse keep blowing in Toronto?</h3>
                <p>Lint buildup in vents is the primary cause - Toronto homes average 2-4 pounds of lint annually. Blocked vents cause overheating above 185-190°F, triggering the thermal fuse. Other causes include crushed or kinked vent hoses, dryer placed too close to walls, and long vent runs in Toronto condos and townhomes.</p>

                <h3>How do I know if my dryer heating element is bad?</h3>
                <p>Signs include no heat production, visible breaks or holes in the coil element, continuity testing shows infinite resistance (should be 10-50 ohms), clothes take multiple cycles to dry, and the dryer runs but produces zero warm air. Testing requires a multimeter and the dryer unplugged.</p>

                <h3>Are gas dryer repairs legal for DIY in Ontario?</h3>
                <p>No. Ontario law requires TSSA (Technical Standards and Safety Authority) certification for all gas appliance work. Only TSSA-certified gas fitters can legally repair gas dryers. DIY gas work voids insurance, risks carbon monoxide poisoning, fire hazards, and legal penalties. Always hire certified professionals for gas dryer repairs.</p>

                <h3>How often should I clean my dryer vent in Toronto?</h3>
                <p>Clean dryer vents every 6-12 months in Toronto homes. Clean every 3-6 months if you have pets, do 8+ loads weekly, or have long vent runs (10+ feet). Toronto Fire Services recommend annual professional cleaning to prevent the 15,000+ dryer fires in Canada annually. Professional cleaning costs $120-$180.</p>

                <h3>What are the safety risks of a dryer not heating properly?</h3>
                <p>Fire hazards from lint buildup ignition (28% of dryer fires), carbon monoxide poisoning from gas dryers with ventilation issues, electrical hazards from damaged wiring or elements, overheating damage to clothing and components, and increased energy costs from extended run times. Address heating issues immediately.</p>

                <h3>Should I repair or replace my old dryer in Toronto?</h3>
                <p>Repair if under 8 years old and repair cost is less than 50% of replacement cost ($300-$400). Replace if over 10 years old, multiple major issues, repair costs exceed $500, frequent breakdowns, or Energy Star models offer 20% savings. New dryers cost $600-$1,500 in Toronto. Factor in disposal fees ($50-$100).</p>

                <h2>Conclusion: Fixing Your Dryer Heating Issues</h2>

                <p>A dryer that won't heat is frustrating but usually repairable at reasonable cost. The key is understanding the difference between gas and electric systems, following Ontario's strict TSSA regulations for gas work, and addressing the root cause - not just replacing blown fuses repeatedly.</p>

                <p><strong>Key takeaways for Toronto homeowners:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Thermal fuse failure causes 60% of heating issues - always clean vents when replacing</li>
                    <li>Electric dryer repairs (thermal fuse, heating element) are DIY-friendly for experienced homeowners</li>
                    <li>Gas dryer repairs require TSSA-certified professionals by law - never attempt DIY</li>
                    <li>Repair costs range $150-$350 for most common issues</li>
                    <li>Annual vent cleaning prevents fires and extends dryer lifespan by years</li>
                    <li>Toronto's climate requires extra attention to winter vent icing and summer humidity</li>
                    <li>Replace dryers over 10 years old when repair costs exceed $400-$500</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Don't let wet laundry pile up. Whether you choose DIY repair for electric dryers or call TSSA-certified professionals for gas models, addressing heating issues quickly prevents further damage and keeps your home safe from fire hazards.</p>
