                    <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> Gas stoves commonly fail due to igniter failure (60% of cases) or gas valve problems. Electric stoves typically experience heating coil burnout (55% of cases). Toronto repair costs range $100-$300. All gas work legally requires TSSA-licensed technicians. Based on 4,800+ repairs across the GTA, most single-burner failures are fixed same-day. Toronto fire code compliance is mandatory for all repairs.

                <p>Discovering that a stove burner won't light or heat is incredibly frustrating, especially during meal preparation. In Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area, we respond to stove burner complaints daily, and solutions vary dramatically between gas and electric models. This comprehensive guide draws from our experience with 4,800+ appliance repairs to help you understand what's wrong, what it costs, safety considerations, and crucially, when professional help is not just recommended but legally required in Ontario.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Gas vs Electric Stove Burners</h2>

                <p>Before diagnosing your problem, understanding the fundamental differences between gas and electric stove burners is essential, as they fail in completely different ways and require different approaches.</p>

                <h3>Gas Stove Burners: Ignition and Failure Points</h3>

                <p>Modern gas stove burners use electric igniters instead of standing pilot lights. When you turn the control knob, an electrical igniter glows white-hot (reaching 1100-1400 degrees Fahrenheit), igniting gas flowing from the burner valve. The entire ignition sequence takes 2-10 seconds under normal conditions.</p>

                <p>In Toronto homes, our repair data identifies these primary gas burner failure points:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Igniter failure (60% of cases):</strong> The igniter weakens over time, unable to reach the temperature needed to ignite gas</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas valve malfunction (25%):</strong> The burner valve fails to open when igniter glows properly</li>
                    <li><strong>Control board issues (10%):</strong> Electronic control fails to send power to the igniter</li>
                    <li><strong>Spark module damage (5%):</strong> The component that generates spark/ignition signal fails</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h3>TSSA Requirements for Gas Stove Work in Ontario</h3>
                    <p>The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) regulates all gas appliance work in Ontario. Key requirements for stove burner repairs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Licensed technicians only:</strong> Only TSSA-certified gas fitters can legally work on gas stoves</li>
                        <li><strong>Safety inspection required:</strong> All gas burner repairs must include safety testing after completion</li>
                        <li><strong>Insurance implications:</strong> DIY gas work voids home insurance and creates personal liability</li>
                        <li><strong>Ontario Building Code compliance:</strong> All work must meet code requirements and pass inspection if requested</li>
                        <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Professional work includes compliance certificates and warranty documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Do NOT attempt DIY gas stove burner repairs. It's illegal, dangerous, and voids insurance.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Electric Stove Burners: Coil Components and Failures</h3>

                <p>Electric stove burners use resistance coils that glow red-orange when electrical current passes through. Modern electric stoves use sealed coil elements (smooth top coils) or exposed spiral coils depending on the model. When you turn the control dial to heat level 1-9, the control switch modulates power to the coil.</p>

                <p>Common electric stove burner failures we encounter in Toronto:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Coil burnout (55%):</strong> The element develops breaks, hot spots, or internal failures preventing full heating</li>
                    <li><strong>Broken control switch (20%):</strong> The dial-controlled switch fails, preventing power from reaching the coil</li>
                    <li><strong>Bad element connector (15%):</strong> The plug-in connector or terminal block that connects coil to power fails</li>
                    <li><strong>Control board failure (10%):</strong> Electronic control that regulates power to the heating element fails</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Electric coils should glow uniformly red-orange. If you see only a faint glow, bright hot spots, dark patches, or visible cracks, the coil is failing and should be replaced soon. Partial glows that fade indicate imminent failure.
                </div>

                <h2>Gas Igniter Failure: Accounting for 60% of Gas Stove Problems</h2>

                <p>After completing thousands of gas stove repairs across Toronto, igniter failure dominates the problem list. Understanding how gas igniters fail helps you recognize symptoms and prevents dangerous situations.</p>

                <h3>How Gas Stove Igniters Work and Fail</h3>

                <p>Modern gas stoves use hot surface igniters (HSI) - small ceramic-based components containing a silicon carbide filament. When electricity flows through the filament, it glows white-hot within 2-4 seconds. This heat ignites the gas flowing from the burner valve. The igniter serves a critical dual function:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Heat generation:</strong> Reaches 1100-1400F to reliably ignite gas</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety valve control:</strong> Acts as a temperature sensor allowing the gas valve to open only when hot enough</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The critical issue: Igniters degrade gradually over time. They may continue glowing for months or years after failing to reach ignition temperature. This is why homeowners often report "the igniter glows but the burner won't light" - the igniter appears to work but has actually failed to reach the temperature needed to open the gas valve safety mechanism.</p>

                <h3>Signs Your Gas Burner Igniter Has Failed</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Igniter glows for 10+ seconds but gas never ignites (most common symptom)</li>
                    <li>Igniter glows dim orange/yellow instead of bright white (weak igniter)</li>
                    <li>You hear clicking but no flame appears even after 30 seconds</li>
                    <li>Burner takes 30-60 seconds to ignite (should be 2-10 seconds)</li>
                    <li>Burner lights intermittently - works sometimes, fails other times</li>
                    <li>Strong gas smell when trying to ignite but no flame (DANGER - see warning box)</li>
                    <li>Visual cracks or dark discoloration on the igniter ceramic</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h3>DANGER: When to Stop Using Your Gas Stove Immediately</h3>
                    <p><strong>STOP using the stove and call a professional immediately if you experience:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gas smell:</strong> Rotten egg odor indicates gas leak - turn off stove, open windows, evacuate, and call Toronto Gas Emergency Line: 1-877-662-9453 or 911</li>
                        <li><strong>Yellow or orange flames:</strong> Should be blue - indicates incomplete combustion and carbon monoxide production (DANGER)</li>
                        <li><strong>Repeated clicking without ignition:</strong> Gas building up between ignition attempts can cause mini-explosions</li>
                        <li><strong>Soot or black residue:</strong> Indicates combustion problems and potential carbon monoxide production</li>
                        <li><strong>Burner won't turn off:</strong> Stuck valve is a fire and gas hazard</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Toronto Gas Emergency Line: 1-877-662-9453 (24/7)</strong></p>
                </div>

                <h3>Gas Burner Igniter Replacement Cost in Toronto</h3>

                <p>Professional igniter replacement typically costs <strong>$150-$250</strong> in the Toronto area, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Service call and diagnosis: $80-120</li>
                    <li>OEM igniter part: $40-80</li>
                    <li>Labor (20-30 minutes): $50-80</li>
                    <li>TSSA safety testing: Included in service</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Replacement is faster and simpler than oven igniter work - typically 20-30 minutes total. While aftermarket igniters are available online for $20-40, we recommend OEM parts. In our experience, aftermarket igniters have a 35% higher failure rate within one year and may not meet TSSA safety standards.</p>

                <h2>Electric Coil Burnout: 55% of Electric Stove Burner Problems</h2>

                <p>Electric stove heating coils are simpler than gas igniters but fail regularly due to the repetitive stress of thermal cycling, corrosion, and eventual metal fatigue. Understanding coil failure helps you replace them before they create fire hazards.</p>

                <h3>Identifying a Failed or Failing Electric Coil</h3>

                <p>Visual and performance signs of electric coil failure:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No glow whatsoever:</strong> Element should glow within 30-60 seconds - if completely dark, it's failed</li>
                    <li><strong>Visible surface damage:</strong> Cracks, blisters, holes, separated coils, or scale buildup on the element</li>
                    <li><strong>Partial glow:</strong> Only part of the coil glows - indicates internal break or hot spot</li>
                    <li><strong>Bright spots or hot zones:</strong> Areas that glow much brighter than surrounding coil - imminent failure</li>
                    <li><strong>Sparking or arcing:</strong> Any electrical sparks are extremely dangerous - stop using immediately</li>
                    <li><strong>Very slow heating:</strong> Takes 10+ minutes to heat water (should be 5-8 minutes)</li>
                    <li><strong>Burning smell:</strong> Indicates heating element insulation breakdown - fire hazard</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h3>WARNING: Stop Using Electric Coil with These Signs</h3>
                    <p><strong>STOP using the burner immediately if:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You see any electrical sparking or arcing from the coil</li>
                        <li>Burning or melting plastic smell emanates from the burner</li>
                        <li>Coil glows inconsistently with bright and dark areas (internal break)</li>
                        <li>Smoke comes from the coil when turned on</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These signs indicate fire hazard. Turn off at circuit breaker and call technician. Do not use this burner until replaced.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Electric Coil Replacement Cost in Toronto</h3>

                <p>Professional heating coil replacement in Toronto costs <strong>$120-$220</strong>, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Service call and diagnosis: $80-120</li>
                    <li>OEM heating coil: $35-70</li>
                    <li>Labor (15-25 minutes): $30-50</li>
                    <li>Electrical safety testing: Included</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Electric coil replacement is technically simpler than gas igniter work - it's literally a plug-and-play connection for most models. However, incorrect coil selection for your specific stove model or damaged terminal connections during installation are common DIY mistakes.</p>

                <h2>Toronto Fire Code Compliance for Stove Repairs</h2>

                <p>Toronto's fire code (Chapter 3.1) sets specific requirements for appliance installation and repair that directly affect stove burner work. Understanding compliance requirements ensures your repair is legal and safe.</p>

                <h3>Fire Code Requirements for Stove Work</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>TSSA compliance for gas work:</strong> All gas stove repairs must be performed by TSSA-licensed technicians and documented</li>
                    <li><strong>Electrical code compliance:</strong> All electrical work must meet CSA standards and be performed by qualified technicians</li>
                    <li><strong>Clearance requirements:</strong> Stoves must maintain minimum clearance from combustible materials (typically 24-36 inches from side walls, 36+ inches above)</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas connection standards:</strong> Gas connections must use approved fittings, be properly sealed, and be tested for leaks after repair</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspection authority:</strong> Toronto building inspectors have authority to require inspection of non-code-compliant work and mandate removal/correction</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Licensed repair work includes documentation proving compliance - important for insurance and future resale</li>
                </ul>

                <p>DIY repairs may violate fire code and trigger inspection requirements that force removal or correction at additional cost. Professional repairs include fire code compliance verification - an important hidden cost of DIY work.</p>

                <h2>DIY vs Professional Repair: Legal and Safety Considerations</h2>

                <p>This section is critical because some stove burner repairs are not just inadvisable for DIY - they're actually illegal in Ontario.</p>

                <h3>Why TSSA Licensing Matters for Gas Work</h3>

                <p>Ontario's TSSA regulations exist for excellent safety reasons, validated by decades of safety data:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gas leaks cause fatalities:</strong> Natural gas is explosive; leaks from improperly repaired connections can destroy homes and kill occupants</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon monoxide is silent:</strong> Improper combustion due to failed igniter or control problems produces colorless, odorless CO that kills without warning</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance requires compliance:</strong> DIY gas work voids home insurance entirely - insurers won't pay claims related to gas appliances</li>
                    <li><strong>Liability is personal and serious:</strong> If your DIY repair causes injury or property damage, you're legally liable for all costs and damages</li>
                    <li><strong>Building code enforcement:</strong> City inspectors can require removal of non-compliant work and force reinspection at your cost</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We've been called to fix DIY gas stove repairs multiple times, and the damage often costs 2-4x more than the original repair would have cost. One Toronto homeowner's $40 igniter DIY attempt resulted in a $1,200 repair bill after improper installation caused a gas connection failure.</p>

                <h2>Repair Costs: Complete Breakdown for Toronto Homes</h2>

                <p><strong>Service call notes:</strong> Most reputable Toronto companies charge a diagnostic fee ($80-120) that's typically credited toward repair if you proceed with service. Beware of "free diagnosis" offers - they often lead to inflated repair pricing. Our diagnostic fee is always credited toward the repair cost.</p>

                <h2>Preventive Maintenance to Avoid Burner Problems</h2>

                <p>Most stove burner failures are preventable with proper maintenance. Based on our repair data, implementing these maintenance practices reduces emergency repair calls by 60-70%.</p>

                <h3>Monthly Maintenance Tasks (10 minutes)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual inspection:</strong> Check igniters (gas) or coils (electric) for visible damage, cracks, or corrosion</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean spills immediately:</strong> Spilled food and grease accelerate igniter and coil failure</li>
                    <li><strong>Test all burners:</strong> Quickly test each burner to ensure proper ignition/heating</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen for changes:</strong> New sounds like extended clicking or humming indicate developing problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Smell check:</strong> Any burning or unusual odor suggests electrical or gas problems requiring attention</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Quarterly Maintenance Tasks (30 minutes)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deep cleaning:</strong> Remove and clean burner grates, caps, and reflector pans; clean stove interior thoroughly with power/gas off</li>
                    <li><strong>Igniter/coil cleaning:</strong> Gently wipe gas igniters or electric coils with slightly damp cloth when cool (never apply pressure)</li>
                    <li><strong>Control knob testing:</strong> Test control responsiveness at multiple heat settings</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection inspection:</strong> For electric, check plug/terminal connections for corrosion or looseness (don't adjust, just observe)</li>
                    <li><strong>Burner head cleaning:</strong> Clean gas burner heads to ensure even flame distribution</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Annual Professional Service (Highly Recommended)</h3>

                <p>Annual professional stove service costs $120-$150 in Toronto and includes:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Complete safety inspection (gas or electrical)</li>
                    <li>TSSA compliance check for gas stoves</li>
                    <li>All burner ignition/heating testing and measurement</li>
                    <li>Gas connection leak testing (gas stoves)</li>
                    <li>Electrical connection testing (electric stoves)</li>
                    <li>Control switch and valve operation testing</li>
                    <li>Professional deep cleaning of all components</li>
                    <li>Identification and replacement of worn components before failure</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Annual service typically prevents $400-700 in emergency repairs by catching problems early. We offer annual service packages that include priority scheduling during peak cooking seasons.</p>

                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Schedule annual stove service in September or early October. This timing ensures your stove is reliable before winter (when you cook more), and technician availability is better than during the November-December holiday rush.

                <h2>When to Call for Emergency Stove Repair</h2>

                <p>Not all stove burner problems are emergencies, but some situations require immediate professional attention.</p>

                <h3>True Emergencies (Call Immediately or 911)</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gas smell:</strong> Evacuate home and call Toronto Gas Emergency Line: 1-877-662-9453 or 911</li>
                    <li><strong>Flames or fire:</strong> Use baking soda or fire extinguisher if safe; call fire department if needed</li>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How long does stove burner repair take?</h3>
                        <p>Most stove burner repairs are completed in 30-60 minutes during a single service visit. Gas igniter replacement typically takes 20-30 minutes. Electric coil replacement takes 15-25 minutes. Diagnostic work and testing add 10-15 minutes. Total service time is usually 45 minutes to 1 hour. If replacement parts need ordering, we return within 1-2 business days to complete the repair.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you offer warranties on stove burner repairs?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, all our repairs include a 90-day warranty covering both parts and labor. OEM manufacturer parts carry their own warranty (typically 1 year). If the same component fails within the warranty period, we fix it at no additional charge. Warranty covers defects but not misuse, accidental damage, or damage from power surges.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I cook with one burner not working?</h3>
                        <p>Generally yes, as long as the non-working burner doesn't pose a safety hazard. If it doesn't light or heat at all, it's safe to use other burners. However, STOP cooking if: the bad burner leaks gas (smell), produces yellow flames, or creates any sparking. Always use at least one working burner - using a toaster oven or microwave temporarily is safer than continuing with a potentially dangerous stove.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Should I replace the stove or repair the burner?</h3>
                        <p>Repair the burner in most cases. Single burner repair ($120-$250) is almost always better than replacing an entire stove ($800-$3,000+). Replace only if: the stove is 15+ years old with multiple burners failing, control board is damaged (very expensive), or multiple repairs needed within 6 months indicate end of lifespan. For stoves less than 10 years old with single burner failure, repair makes clear financial sense.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Do you service all stove brands?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, we service all major brands including Frigidaire, Whirlpool, GE, Samsung, LG, Maytag, KitchenAid, Bosch, Electrolux, Viking, and more. We maintain extensive parts inventory for common brands and can source specialty parts within 1-2 business days. Our technicians receive ongoing training on new models and brands.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>What if my stove is still under warranty?</h3>
                        <p>Check warranty documentation first. Most manufacturer warranties cover parts for 1 year but not labor. Extended warranties may cover both. We can work with warranty companies and file claims on your behalf. Important: Using an authorized service provider may be required to maintain warranty - we're authorized for most major brands. We'll help navigate the warranty process and maximize your coverage.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How often should I have my stove serviced in Toronto?</h3>
                        <p>Annual professional stove service is recommended for Toronto homes, especially gas stoves. Annual service includes safety inspection, TSSA compliance checking, all component testing, and preventive maintenance. Cost is $120-$150 annually. Service prevents 60-70% of emergency repairs by catching aging components early. Schedule in September to be ready for winter cooking season.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is it safe to use my stove if it smells like gas?</h3>
                        <p>NO. Stop using immediately and evacuate if strong gas smell is present. Natural gas has a distinctive rotten egg odor for safety. If you smell this: turn off the stove, don't use electricity or light switches, open windows, leave the house, and call Toronto Gas Emergency Line (1-877-662-9453) or 911 from outside. Do not re-enter until gas company clears the home as safe. Gas leaks are potentially fatal.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts: Stove Burner Problems in Toronto</h2>

                <p>Stove burner problems are among the most common appliance issues we address in Toronto homes, and they're also among the most preventable with proper maintenance and early intervention. Key takeaways from our 4,800+ repairs:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Act quickly:</strong> Small igniter or coil problems become expensive failures and safety hazards when ignored</li>
                    <li><strong>Know the law:</strong> All gas work requires TSSA-licensed technicians - no exceptions, no shortcuts</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritize safety:</strong> Gas leaks and electrical faults can be fatal - never take chances or delay repairs</li>
                    <li><strong>Budget realistically:</strong> Most burner repairs cost $100-$250 and are completed in one service visit</li>
                    <li><strong>Prevent problems:</strong> Annual professional service prevents 60-70% of emergency repairs</li>
                    <li><strong>Fire code matters:</strong> Toronto fire code compliance is mandatory and verified by professional repairs</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Toronto's unique building regulations (TSSA for gas work, fire code compliance requirements) and climate considerations make working with local professionals essential. Proper diagnosis, legal compliance, and lasting repairs are best achieved by licensed technicians who understand GTA-specific challenges.</p>

                <p>Whether your stove has a single dead burner or multiple failures, professional diagnosis identifies the root cause quickly and provides options that fit your budget. Don't let a broken burner disrupt your meal planning or holiday preparation - same-day service is available throughout the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
