            <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
            <section>
                <h2>Understanding Your Stove: Gas vs. Electric</h2>
                <p>Before diving into repairs, it's important to understand how your stove works. Gas and electric stoves operate on fundamentally different principles, and the problems they developâ€”and their solutionsâ€”vary significantly. A gas stove relies on a precise ignition system and gas valve regulation, while an electric stove depends on heating elements and control switches. Knowing which type you have is the first step in diagnosing issues and determining whether DIY troubleshooting is safe or if professional service is necessary.</p>

                <p>In Toronto's diverse housing market, you'll find both gas and electric stoves, each with its own set of advantages and challenges. Gas stoves are prized for their instant heat control and many home cooks prefer them for their responsiveness. Electric stoves, on the other hand, are often more affordable to install and don't require gas line connections. However, both types require proper maintenance and timely repairs to function safely and efficiently. Understanding the differences helps you communicate more effectively with repair technicians and make informed decisions about maintenance and replacement.</p>

                <p>The good news is that most stove problems are repairable. Whether your issue stems from a simple burner cap misalignment or a more complex valve malfunction, experienced Toronto technicians have seen it all and can restore your stove to working condition quickly. The key is recognizing when professional help is needed and acting fast, especially when safety is involved.</p>

            <!-- GAS STOVE PROBLEMS -->
            <section>
                <h2>Gas Stove Problems & Solutions</h2>

                <p>Gas stoves in Toronto are incredibly popular, but they come with specific repair challenges. Understanding the most common issues helps you recognize when your stove needs attention and what to expect from a repair visit.</p>

                <div class="comparison-item gas">
                    <h4>Common Gas Stove Issues</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Igniter not sparking (60% of gas stove issues)</li>
                        <li>Gas valve malfunction (20%)</li>
                        <li>Burner cap misalignment (15%)</li>
                        <li>Thermostat problems (15%)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Gas Igniter Not Sparking (60% of Issues)</h3>
                <p>The most common gas stove problem is an igniter that won't spark. When you turn the knob, you hear clicking but see no spark, or the spark is weak and inconsistent. This means the burner won't light, leaving you without heat for cooking. The igniter is typically a ceramic or metal electrode that creates a spark to ignite the gas. Over time, moisture from cooking, cleaning, or just humidity can corrode the igniter or disrupt its electrical connection.</p>

                <p>Common causes include moisture buildup, food debris blocking the igniter tip, or a faulty igniter assembly. While some people try cleaning the igniter with a toothbrush and vinegar, this temporary fix rarely works long-term. A professional technician will test the igniter's electrical resistance and replace it if necessary. Cost for igniter repair in Toronto typically ranges from $200 to $350, depending on labor and stove brand.</p>

                <h3>Gas Valve Malfunction (20%)</h3>
                <p>The gas valve controls the flow of gas to your burners. When it malfunctions, you might experience uneven heat, difficulty lighting burners, or gas that continues flowing even after you turn off the burner. A faulty valve is a serious safety concern and should be addressed immediately. You might smell gas, hear hissing from the burner, or notice the flame behavior is abnormalâ€”either too high, too low, or flickering.</p>

                <p>Valve replacement is not a DIY job. It requires TSSA (Technical Standards and Safety Authority) certification in Ontario to work safely with gas lines. A professional technician will test gas pressure, inspect the valve for blockages, and replace it if necessary. Valve replacement costs between $300 and $500, plus labor. Because this is a safety issue, any concerns warrant an immediate professional inspection.</p>

                <h3>Burner Cap Misalignment (15%)</h3>
                <p>Sometimes the solution is simpler than you think. The burner capâ€”the piece that sits under the flame and distributes heatâ€”can shift out of position. If it's misaligned, gas won't flow properly or will distribute unevenly, creating an uneven or weak flame. This is especially common after cleaning or when something bumps into the stovetop.</p>

                <p>You can often fix this yourself: simply lift the cap and reposition it so the small holes align perfectly with the burner tube beneath. If the cap is cracked or damaged, replacement caps are inexpensive and readily available.</p>

                <h3>Thermostat Issues (15%)</h3>
                <p>If your oven temperature doesn't match the setting or fluctuates unexpectedly, the thermostat might be faulty. This affects your oven's temperature regulation, making baking difficult or impossible. A professional will test the thermostat with specialized equipment and replace it if needed. Thermostat replacement typically costs $200-$400.</p>

            <!-- ELECTRIC STOVE PROBLEMS -->
            <section>
                <h2>Electric Stove Problems & Solutions</h2>

                <p>Electric stoves operate differently from gas stoves, and their problems require different solutions. Electric stoves rely on resistance heating through coils or smooth glass surfaces. When issues develop, they're usually with these heating elements or the control systems that manage them.</p>

                <div class="comparison-item">
                    <h4>Common Electric Stove Issues</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coil burner failure (55% of electric stove issues)</li>
                        <li>Heating element burned out (35%)</li>
                        <li>Control switch failure (20%)</li>
                        <li>Temperature inconsistency (25%)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Coil Burner Failure (55%)</h3>
                <p>The traditional coil burner is the most common heating element on electric stoves. These red or gray coils glow when heated and transfer heat to your cookware. Over time, they wear outâ€”especially if exposed to water, acidic spills, or physical damage. A failed coil won't glow at all, won't heat, or might have visible cracks or burn marks.</p>

                <p>The good news is that coil replacement is straightforward and affordable. The coil simply plugs into a terminal beneath the stovetop, making it a quick swap. Replacement coils cost $75-$200 depending on your stove model. This is one repair many homeowners handle themselves, though professional installation ensures proper fitting and safety.</p>

                <h3>Heating Element Burned Out (35%)</h3>
                <p>On smooth-top electric stoves, the heating elements are beneath the glass surface. When these fail, the burner won't heat even though the rest of the stove functions normally. Burned-out elements often show themselves through slow or no heat development. Unlike traditional coils, smooth-top elements can't be easily replaced by homeownersâ€”the glass cooktop must be removed carefully.</p>

                <p>Professional replacement is recommended for smooth-top stoves. The technician will assess whether the element itself failed or if it's a control board issue. Element replacement typically costs $150-$300, including labor. The service usually takes 1-2 hours.</p>

                <h3>Control Switch Failure (20%)</h3>
                <p>The control switches or dials regulate power to your burners. A failing switch might not respond to adjustments, stick in one position, or randomly cut power to the burner. You'll notice the burner won't turn on even when the switch is activated, or it stays on when you've turned it off.</p>

                <p>Testing a switch requires a multimeter and electrical knowledge, so professional diagnosis is recommended. Replacement switches cost $150-$300 installed, depending on your stove model. This is a straightforward repair that doesn't require extensive disassembly of your stove.</p>

                <h3>Temperature Inconsistency (25%)</h3>
                <p>If one burner heats much faster than others, or if some burners run hotter than others, you likely have a control or element issue. This might be caused by a failing control switch, a partially burned element, or damaged wiring. A technician will test each circuit and identify which component needs replacement.</p>

                <h2>Safety Considerations: Critical Information</h2>

                <p>Safety must be your top priority when dealing with stove repairs. Both gas and electric stoves involve potential hazards if not handled properly. Understanding these risks and knowing when to call a professional is essential for protecting your family and home.</p>

                <div class="safety-critical">
                    <h4>Gas Safety: Why Professional Service is Non-Negotiable</h4>
                    <p>In Ontario, anyone working on gas appliances must be TSSA (Technical Standards and Safety Authority) certified. This isn't just a recommendationâ€”it's the law. TSSA certification requires specific training in gas safety, pressure testing, and proper installation procedures. When your gas stove needs repair, always verify that your technician holds valid TSSA certification.</p>
                    <p>Why? Gas leaks can accumulate in your home, creating an explosion risk. Improper repairs can create hidden leaks that aren't immediately apparent but pose serious danger. You might smell rotten eggs (the gas is odorless; this is an additive), hear hissing, or notice symptoms like headaches or dizziness. If you suspect a gas leak, immediately turn off the stove and gas supply, exit the home, call Toronto emergency services, and call a TSSA-certified technician.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="safety-warning">
                    <h4>Electrical Safety for Electric Stoves</h4>
                    <p>Electric stoves operate on 240-volt circuitsâ€”much higher than standard outlets. Working on these circuits without proper knowledge can cause electrocution or electrical fires. Never attempt electrical repairs yourself unless you're a licensed electrician. Always turn off power at the breaker before working on any electrical components. If you see sparks, smell burning, or notice scorch marks, turn off the stove immediately and call a professional.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Never Use Your Stove as a Heater</h3>
                <p>Some people leave their ovens or stovetops on to warm their homes, especially during colder Toronto winters. This is extremely dangerous. Stoves aren't designed for space heating and can cause carbon monoxide buildup, especially with gas stoves. This odorless, deadly gas can accumulate quickly in closed spaces. Always use proper heating systems for warmth, never your stove.</p>

                <h3>Proper Ventilation is Essential</h3>
                <p>Proper ventilation above your stove (through a hood or vent) is crucial. It removes cooking fumes, moisture, and any potential gas leaks. If your range hood isn't working, have it repaired promptly. Improper ventilation can allow gas to accumulate or cause moisture damage to your stove. Ensure your hood vents outside, not just into your home.</p>

                <h3>Regular Inspection and Maintenance</h3>
                <p>Small problems become big problems quickly with stoves. Have your stove inspected annually by a professional, especially if it's a gas model. Simple maintenance like cleaning burner caps, checking connections, and testing ignition systems can prevent emergency repairs down the line. Catching issues early saves money and ensures your family's safety.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Stove Repair vs. Replacement: Making the Smart Choice</h2>

                <p>When your stove breaks, one of the first questions homeowners ask is: should I fix it or replace it? The answer depends on several factors: the age of your stove, the cost of repair, and the reliability of the appliance overall.</p>

                <table class="cost-table">
                    <thead>

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h3>Cost Analysis: Repair vs. Replace</h3>
                <p>As a general rule, if repair costs less than 50% of a replacement stove's price, repair is usually the better choice. A basic electric stove costs $400-$800 new. If your repair is under $200-$400, fixing it makes financial sense. However, if you're looking at a $500 control board replacement on a 12-year-old stove, and new stoves start at $600, replacement might be wiser.</p>

                <h3>When to Replace Your Stove</h3>
                <p>Replace your stove if: it's over 10-12 years old (typical lifespan), repairs are exceeding 50% of replacement cost, multiple components are failing simultaneously, or the stove model is obsolete and parts are hard to find. Modern stoves often have better energy efficiency and features than older models, and replacement might be more economical long-term.</p>

                <h3>Financing Options for Replacement</h3>
                <p>If replacement is necessary but seems unaffordable, consider these options: many appliance retailers offer financing (0% APR for 12-24 months), some offer instant rebates on certain models, and credit cards often provide cash back on major purchases. At Nika Appliance Repair, we can help you evaluate whether repair or replacement makes sense for your situation and discuss available options.</p>
