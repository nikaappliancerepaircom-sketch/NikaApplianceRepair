        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section class="intro-section">
            <h2>Why Dryer Repair Matters in Toronto</h2>
            <p>Toronto's climate presents unique challenges for household appliances. Our humid summers and unpredictable weather patterns mean your dryer works overtime to handle moisture that other regions might never encounter. A malfunctioning dryer isn't just an inconvenience—it's a safety concern and a financial issue that compounds over time.</p>

            <p>When your dryer isn't working efficiently, you're wasting energy on longer cycles, pushing your hydro bills higher each month. A dryer that takes twice as long to dry clothes is consuming double the electricity, adding up to hundreds of dollars in wasted energy annually. Beyond the financial impact, an inefficient or broken dryer can indicate underlying problems that could create fire hazards if left unchecked.</p>

            <p>Understanding common dryer problems helps you know when to call for professional service versus attempting DIY fixes that might cause more damage. Most dryer repairs in Toronto fall into predictable categories, and recognizing the symptoms of each problem helps you describe the issue clearly to your technician, speeding up diagnostics and repairs.</p>

            <p>Professional dryer repair in Toronto is an investment in appliance longevity, home safety, and energy efficiency. With proper maintenance and prompt repairs, you can extend your dryer's lifespan by years, avoiding the $800-$1,500+ cost of replacing an entire appliance prematurely.</p>

        <!-- Common Dryer Problems Section -->
        <section class="section section-blue">
            <h2>Common Dryer Problems in Toronto</h2>
            <p>Most dryer issues fall into five major categories. Understanding what's wrong with your dryer helps you communicate the problem clearly to your repair technician and understand what solution is needed. Here's what Toronto homeowners encounter most frequently:</p>

            <div class="problem-item">
                <h4>1. Dryer Not Heating</h4>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Your dryer runs but clothes remain damp after a full cycle. The dryer isn't producing heat, leaving your laundry as wet as when you put it in.</p>
                <p><strong>Most Common Causes:</strong> This is the most frequent dryer complaint we receive at Nika Appliance Repair. The thermal fuse (which resets if the dryer gets too hot) blows when the vent is blocked or restricted. The heating element burns out after years of use. The hi-limit thermostat fails, stopping the heating element from activating. Gas dryers might have a faulty igniter or gas valve issue.</p>
                <p><span class="percentage">60% of cases = Thermal fuse or heating element</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="problem-item">
                <h4>2. Dryer Not Drying Clothes Completely</h4>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> The dryer runs longer than normal, or clothes stay damp even after extended cycles. You're running the same load twice just to get clothes dry.</p>
                <p><strong>Most Common Causes:</strong> Lint accumulation in the lint trap (which should be cleaned before every load) blocks airflow. The vent hose is clogged with lint buildup from inadequate vent cleaning. Ductwork has become partially blocked over time. The blower wheel collects lint and spins inefficiently.</p>
                <p><span class="percentage">75% of cases = Lint trap or vent clogging</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="problem-item">
                <h4>3. Dryer Making Unusual Noises</h4>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Loud thumping, squeaking, grinding, or rattling sounds coming from your dryer during operation. The noise gets progressively louder over weeks or months.</p>
                <p><strong>Most Common Causes:</strong> Drum rollers wear out and the drum no longer spins smoothly (often audible as thumping). The felt seal around the drum is worn, allowing fabric to contact the metal drum (squeaking sound). The idler pulley is failing and can't keep tension on the belt. Blower wheel damage causes rattling. Foreign objects (coins, buttons) are caught inside.</p>
                <p><span class="percentage">40% bearing issues, 25% felt seal</span></p>
            </div>

            <div class="problem-item">
                <h4>4. Dryer Won't Start</h4>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> You push the start button, but nothing happens. The dryer is plugged in and power is available, but the motor doesn't turn.</p>
                <p><strong>Most Common Causes:</strong> The door latch is broken or misaligned, preventing the dryer from operating (a safety feature). The thermal switch has activated due to overheating and stopped the dryer. The start button is worn out and no longer makes contact. The belt is broken and can't turn the drum. The motor has failed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="problem-item">
                <h4>5. Burning Smell from Dryer</h4>
                <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> A burning odor comes from your dryer, especially during the first few minutes of operation. The smell might be acrid or like singed fabric.</p>
                <p><strong>Most Common Causes:</strong> Lint has accumulated on the heating element or inside the ductwork and is burning when heat is applied. The heating element itself is deteriorating and creating a burning smell. Belt friction is excessive due to a worn idler pulley.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong style="color: #E74C3C;">WARNING:</strong> Any burning smell requires immediate attention. Stop using the dryer and have it inspected professionally before using it again.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Lint & Vent Maintenance Section -->
        <section class="section section-green">
            <h2>Lint & Vent Maintenance: Your First Defense</h2>
            <p>Toronto's humidity levels make lint and vent maintenance even more critical than in drier climates. Our moist air carries more moisture into the dryer, which combines with lint to create a sticky accumulation that clogs vents faster than homeowners expect. This section covers the maintenance that prevents most dryer problems and fire hazards.</p>

            <h3>Toronto Humidity and Lint Accumulation</h3>
            <p>Our Great Lakes region's humidity means your dryer is constantly processing moisture-heavy loads. Unlike arid regions where lint dries out and moves through vents easily, Toronto's moisture causes lint to stick to vent walls and heating elements. This sticky accumulation builds up 20-30% faster in our climate, making preventive maintenance essential.</p>

            <p>When moisture-laden lint accumulates in your vent system, it creates the perfect conditions for airflow restriction. Your dryer has to work harder, runs longer, uses more energy, and generates excessive heat. This is when the thermal fuse blows or the heating element burns out.</p>

            <h3>The Fire Hazard You Can't Ignore</h3>
            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4><span class="warning-icon">⚠️</span> Critical Fire Risk</h4>
                <p>Clogged dryer vents are responsible for an estimated 15,600+ house fires annually in North America. In Toronto's GTA region with thousands of multi-unit residences, a dryer fire can spread to neighboring units and create evacuation emergencies.</p>
                <p><strong>Lint is highly flammable.</strong> When it accumulates in a 200+ degree environment with restricted airflow, it's essentially a fuel source waiting for ignition. Professional vent cleaning isn't optional—it's a fire prevention measure.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How to Maintain Your Dryer Vent</h3>
            <p><strong>Daily:</strong> Empty your lint trap before every load. This is the single most important maintenance task. A full lint trap reduces efficiency by 30% and creates a fire hazard immediately.</p>

            <p><strong>Monthly:</strong> Check your vent hood on the outside of your home. Ensure the flapper opens freely and isn't blocked by debris, lint buildup, or bird nests. This is a common issue in Toronto homes where squirrels and birds often block vents.</p>

            <p><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Inspect the vent hose behind your dryer (the flexible aluminum duct). Look for dents, crushing, or separated sections that restrict airflow. Replace if damaged.</p>

            <p><strong>Annually:</strong> Schedule professional vent cleaning. This service removes lint buildup that household maintenance can't reach. Professional equipment reaches deep into your entire vent system, from the dryer exit to the exterior hood. For Toronto homes, this should happen at the end of summer before fall and winter's increased drying loads.</p>

            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>Professional Vent Cleaning Benefits</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduces drying time by 25-40%, lowering energy costs significantly</li>
                    <li>Eliminates fire hazard from lint accumulation</li>
                    <li>Extends dryer lifespan by reducing strain from overheating</li>
                    <li>Improves indoor air quality by ensuring exhaust vents properly</li>
                    <li>Professional diagnosis of any vent damage or design issues</li>

        <!-- Thermal Fuse vs Heating Element Section -->
        <section class="section section-red">
            <h2>Thermal Fuse vs Heating Element: Understanding Your Biggest Repair</h2>
            <p>Two components cause the majority of dryer heating problems: the thermal fuse and the heating element. Both are common repairs, but they're different components with different failure patterns. Understanding the difference helps you understand what your technician is explaining when they diagnose your dryer.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Key Fact: Thermal Fuse is Most Common</h4>
                <p>60% of dryer heating failures are caused by a blown thermal fuse. This component is a one-time-only safety device that cannot be reset or reused—it must be replaced.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What is a Thermal Fuse?</h3>
            <p>The thermal fuse is a safety device that melts at a specific temperature (typically 355°F) to stop the dryer from overheating. Unlike a reset thermostat, the thermal fuse is a one-use-only component. When it blows, it cannot be reset or repaired—it must be replaced.</p>

            <p><strong>Why do thermal fuses blow?</strong> The primary reason is airflow restriction. When your vent is partially clogged with lint, the dryer's internal temperature rises because hot air can't escape efficiently. The thermal fuse detects this dangerous temperature rise and blows to prevent a fire. This is actually the fuse doing its job—protecting your home from a fire hazard.</p>

            <p><strong>Common myth:</strong> "My thermal fuse keeps blowing—something is wrong with it." Actually, if your fuse blows repeatedly, it's almost always a vent clogging problem, not a faulty fuse. Replacing the fuse without clearing the vent will result in the replacement fuse blowing again within weeks.</p>

            <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Thermal fuse replacement typically costs $150-$300 including parts and labor. This is among the most affordable dryer repairs.</p>

            <h3>What is a Heating Element?</h3>
            <p>The heating element is the component that actually generates heat for your dryer. It's an electric resistance element (in electric dryers) or works with the igniter (in gas dryers). Unlike the thermal fuse, the heating element can accumulate mineral deposits and burn out gradually.</p>

            <p><strong>Why do heating elements fail?</strong> Extended use causes the heating element to eventually wear out. Hard water minerals can accumulate on the element (especially in areas with mineral-rich water like parts of Toronto), reducing efficiency and causing burnout. Moisture buildup from high humidity can corrode the element terminals. Dust and lint accumulation can cause excessive heat concentration.</p>

            <p><strong>Preventable factors:</strong> While heating elements eventually fail after years of use, you can extend their lifespan through proper vent maintenance (ensuring adequate airflow), cleaning lint traps religiously, and having annual professional vent cleaning.</p>

            <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Heating element replacement typically costs $200-$400 including parts and labor, making it slightly more expensive than thermal fuse replacement.</p>

            <h3>How to Prevent Both Problems</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clean your lint trap before every single load.</strong> This is the most important prevention step. A full lint trap forces your dryer to work harder and generates excessive heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Have annual professional vent cleaning.</strong> This removes lint buildup that household cleaning can't reach, ensuring your dryer isn't working overtime.</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect your vent regularly.</strong> Monthly checks of your exterior vent hood ensure nothing is blocking airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't ignore burning smells or slow drying.</strong> These are early warning signs that your dryer needs professional attention before components fail.</li>
                <li><strong>Use shorter dryer cycles.</strong> Modern dryers have moisture sensors that stop the cycle when clothes are dry. Don't run long automatic cycles if clothes dry faster.</li>

        <!-- DIY Safety Checks Section -->
        <section class="section section-green">
            <h2>DIY Safety Checks You Can Perform at Home</h2>
            <p>You can perform several safe diagnostic checks that help your technician understand your dryer's problem. These checks should take 10-15 minutes and require no special tools. Never attempt internal repairs yourself—the electrical and gas components inside a dryer can be extremely dangerous. These checks are observation-only and completely safe for homeowners.</p>

            <h3>Check 1: Lint Trap Inspection</h3>
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Remove your lint trap from your dryer and clean it thoroughly. Use your fingers to pull out lint, then use a soft brush to remove finer particles. Rinse it with water and let it dry completely.</p>

            <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Is the trap clogged with lint? A surprisingly full trap indicates your dryer has been struggling. Does the trap have any damage? Cracks or holes in the trap allow lint to bypass the filter and clog internal components.</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> If your lint trap is always full, it's the #1 reason your dryer is underperforming. Cleaning it properly often solves slow drying problems immediately.</p>

            <h3>Check 2: Vent Hood Inspection</h3>
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Go outside to your house and locate your dryer vent hood (usually on the side of your house or roof). Look at the opening and observe if air is flowing out when your dryer is running.</p>

            <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Is warm air coming out when the dryer is running? Or does it seem blocked? Are there any visible lint accumulations around the hood? Is the flapper opening and closing freely? Are there bird nests, leaves, or debris blocking the opening?</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> If no air is flowing out, your vent is completely clogged. If barely any air comes out, it's partially restricted. This is the most common cause of dryer problems in Toronto homes.</p>

            <h3>Check 3: Vent Hose Inspection</h3>
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Carefully pull your dryer away from the wall (unplug it first). Look at the vent hose that runs from your dryer to the vent opening. Check its entire length for damage.</p>

            <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Is the hose kinked or crushed anywhere? Are there dents that restrict airflow? Is the hose separated at any connection points? Is it the rigid aluminum type (good) or plastic/vinyl type (problematic)? Can you easily feel warm air flowing through the hose when the dryer is running?</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> A damaged or crushed hose significantly restricts airflow, causing many of the problems homeowners experience. Plastic hoses are fire hazards and should be replaced with rigid aluminum ducts.</p>

            <h3>Check 4: Dryer Plug and Connection</h3>
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Check the electrical plug at the wall. For electric dryers, this is usually a 240-volt connection with four prongs. For gas dryers, it's a standard 120-volt plug. Ensure the plug is fully inserted and the outlet isn't loose.</p>

            <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Is the plug fully connected? Is there any burn marks or damage around the outlet? Does the plug wiggle loosely in the outlet?</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> A loose plug or damaged outlet prevents your dryer from operating properly and creates an electrical hazard. This is one of the few issues you can safely fix yourself—simply ensuring the connection is secure.</p>

            <h3>Check 5: Listen to the Sounds</h3>
            <p><strong>What to do:</strong> Run your dryer for 30 seconds and listen to the sounds it makes. Note any unusual noises—squeaking, grinding, thumping, rattling, or hissing.</p>

            <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> Does the motor turn on? Does the drum spin? Are there unusual sounds? Do the sounds change during the cycle?</p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> The sounds your dryer makes tell your technician a lot about what's wrong. Thumping usually means drum rollers are wearing out. Squeaking suggests felt seal deterioration. Grinding could indicate a worn blower wheel.</p>

                <h4><span class="warning-icon">⚠️</span> Never Attempt These Repairs Yourself</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Never disassemble your dryer's internal components</li>
                    <li>Never replace the heating element yourself (electrical hazard)</li>
                    <li>Never work on gas connections (gas leak hazard)</li>
                    <li>Never attempt to replace the drum or drum seals</li>

        <!-- Dryer Types Section -->
        <section class="section section-blue">
            <h2>Gas vs Electric Dryers & Heat Pump Models</h2>
            <p>Toronto homeowners use three types of dryers, each with different repair considerations. Understanding your dryer type helps you communicate the problem to your technician and understand repair explanations.</p>

            <h3>Electric Dryers (Most Common in Toronto)</h3>
            <p><strong>How they work:</strong> Electric dryers use a heating element that produces heat directly, similar to how a toaster works. You plug them into a standard dryer outlet (240 volts) and they heat air internally.</p>

            <p><strong>Common repairs:</strong> Heating element failure, thermal fuse blowing, drum roller wear, idler pulley replacement. Because they use direct electric heating, most repairs involve the heating element or electrical components.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Lower upfront cost than gas models, easier to install (standard outlet), simpler mechanical design means fewer complex repairs.</p>

            <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Higher operating costs (electricity is more expensive than natural gas), longer drying times in some models.</p>

            <h3>Gas Dryers (Growing in Toronto)</h3>
            <p><strong>How they work:</strong> Gas dryers use natural gas (supplied through your home's gas line) or propane to heat air. An igniter or glow stick ignites the gas, and a flame heats the air inside the drum.</p>

            <p><strong>Common repairs:</strong> Igniter failure (similar to the heating element in electric dryers), thermal fuse blowing, drum seal wear, idler pulley replacement. Gas dryers also have gas valves that can fail.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Lower operating costs (natural gas is less expensive than electricity), faster drying times because gas heat is more efficient.</p>

            <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Higher upfront cost, require gas connection (installation more complex), require proper venting to prevent carbon monoxide issues.</p>

            <h3>Heat Pump Dryers (Emerging in Toronto)</h3>
            <p><strong>How they work:</strong> Heat pump dryers use similar technology to air conditioning systems—they extract heat from air and recycle it for drying. This is the most energy-efficient technology available.</p>

            <p><strong>Common repairs:</strong> Compressor issues, refrigerant leaks, pump failures. These are more complex repairs requiring specialized technicians.</p>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Extremely energy-efficient (lowest operating costs), gentle on fabrics, environmental benefits.</p>

            <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> High upfront cost, longer drying times, require specialized technicians for repairs.</p>

            <h3>Repair vs Replacement Decision</h3>
            <p><strong>Consider repair if:</strong> Your dryer is less than 7 years old, the repair costs less than $400, and the dryer is otherwise in good condition. Most dryer repairs are worthwhile investments that extend appliance lifespan significantly.</p>

            <p><strong>Consider replacement if:</strong> Your dryer is older than 10 years and multiple components are failing, the repair costs exceed $600 (more than half a new dryer's cost), or you're experiencing constant issues requiring multiple service calls within a year.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Dryer Repair in Toronto</h2>
            <p>Here are the questions we hear most frequently from Toronto homeowners dealing with dryer problems.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You should clean your lint trap before every single load and inspect your vent hood monthly. Professional vent cleaning should be performed at least once per year, and in Toronto's humid climate, twice per year is ideal—once before summer and once before fall/winter when drying loads increase. If you notice longer drying times or reduced airflow, clean immediately rather than waiting for your scheduled cleaning.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Repeated thermal fuse blowing is almost always caused by vent restriction, not a faulty fuse. When your vent is clogged with lint, the dryer can't exhaust hot air efficiently, internal temperature rises, and the thermal fuse blows to prevent overheating. Simply replacing the fuse without addressing the vent clogging will result in the replacement fuse blowing again within days or weeks. Have your vent professionally cleaned to solve this recurring issue.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Plastic or vinyl vent hoses are fire hazards and are not code-compliant in Toronto. They are easily damaged, trap lint more easily than rigid hoses, and can melt if exposed to high heat. Always use rigid aluminum ductwork or semi-rigid aluminum hoses. This is one of the few upgrades we strongly recommend making if you find your dryer using plastic hose.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No—stop using your dryer immediately if you detect any burning smell. A burning smell indicates lint accumulation near a heat source or a failing component. This is a fire hazard that requires professional inspection before you use the dryer again. Turn off your dryer, unplug it, and call for service. Don't attempt to diagnose the problem yourself.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>With proper maintenance, a quality dryer should last 12-15 years. Most dryer repairs address individual components (thermal fuse, heating element, rollers) that can be replaced to extend the appliance's lifespan. When your dryer reaches 10+ years and repairs are becoming more frequent, it's time to consider replacement. Calculate whether repair costs are becoming more than 50% of a new dryer's cost.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Longer drying times are caused by airflow restriction in 90% of cases. Your lint trap is probably clogged, your vent hose is kinked or crushed, or your vent hood is blocked. These issues force your dryer to work overtime with insufficient airflow. Start by thoroughly cleaning your lint trap and checking your vent. If that doesn't solve it, your dryer vent needs professional cleaning. If the problem persists after vent cleaning, the heating element may be failing.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Use the "50% rule": if repair costs exceed 50% of a new dryer's cost, replacement is usually more economical. For example, if a new dryer costs $600 and the repair is $350, repair it. If the repair is $400, replacement might be smarter. Also consider your dryer's age—if it's 10+ years old with multiple component failures, replacement is usually the better choice. A new energy-efficient dryer will save money on operating costs over time.</p>

This is a preventive maintenance service that prevents more expensive repairs down the road. A $150 vent cleaning now can prevent a $300+ thermal fuse replacement caused by vent clogging. It's an investment that saves money by preventing dryer problems.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>If your dryer is taking significantly longer than it used to, it's working inefficiently and using excess energy. A dryer that takes 60 minutes to dry a load that used to take 30 minutes is using double the electricity. This indicates lint/vent issues or component failure. Have it inspected—cleaning your vent or replacing the heating element will reduce energy use immediately. A professional vent cleaning saves money on hydro costs within a few months.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>First, check that the dryer is plugged in completely and the outlet works (test with another appliance). Check the dryer's circuit breaker in your home's electrical panel—reset it if it's in the "off" position. Check that the door is closing completely; many dryers have a safety feature preventing operation if the door isn't latched. If the door closes, plug is secure, and the breaker is on, you need professional service. Common causes are: broken start button, blown thermal fuse, failed motor, or broken belt.</p>
