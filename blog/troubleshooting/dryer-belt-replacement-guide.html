                            <p>When your dryer stops spinning, a broken belt is often the culprit. The dryer belt is a thin rubber band that wraps around the drum and connects to the motor through a pulley system. When it breaks, the motor runs but the drum doesn't turn, leaving your clothes wet and your laundry routine disrupted.</p>

                            <p>The good news? Replacing a dryer belt is a manageable DIY project for most homeowners. With basic tools and about 30-45 minutes of time, you can save $150-200 in professional repair costs. This guide covers everything from diagnosis to completion.</p>

                            <h2 id="how-dryer-belts-work">How Dryer Belts Work</h2>

                            <p>Understanding your dryer's belt system helps with both diagnosis and repair. Here's how the components work together:</p>

                            <h3>The Belt System Components</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Dryer Belt:</strong> A thin, flat rubber belt (typically 3/8" to 1/2" wide and 80-90" long) that wraps around the drum</li>
                                <li><strong>Motor Pulley:</strong> A small wheel on the motor shaft that drives the belt</li>
                                <li><strong>Idler Pulley:</strong> A spring-loaded pulley that maintains proper belt tension</li>
                                <li><strong>Drum:</strong> The large cylinder that holds your clothes</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The motor turns the motor pulley, which pulls the belt. The belt wraps around the entire drum circumference, causing the drum to rotate. The idler pulley creates tension to keep the belt tight and prevent slipping.</p>

                            <div class="tip-box">
                                <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Pro Tip</h4>
                                <p>When replacing your belt, it's wise to also inspect the idler pulley and motor pulley. Worn pulleys can damage a new belt quickly, turning one repair into repeated failures.</p>
                            </div>

                            <p>Before ordering parts or taking anything apart, confirm that the belt is actually the problem. Here are the telltale signs:</p>

                            <h3>How to Test for a Broken Belt</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Start the dryer:</strong> Press start and listen carefully</li>
                                <li><strong>Listen for the motor:</strong> You should hear a humming sound</li>
                                <li><strong>Check for tumbling:</strong> Open the door - the drum should be stationary</li>
                                <li><strong>Try spinning the drum:</strong> With the dryer off, spin the drum by hand. If it spins very easily with no resistance, the belt is broken</li>
                            </ol>

                            <div class="warning-box">
                                <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Similar Symptoms, Different Problems</h4>
                                <p>A drum that won't spin could also indicate a broken idler pulley, seized drum rollers, or a motor problem. If the drum is hard to turn by hand, the issue is likely drum rollers or bearings, not the belt.</p>
                            </div>

                                <li><strong>Squealing noise:</strong> High-pitched squeal during operation</li>
                                <li><strong>Thumping sound:</strong> Regular thump as the drum rotates</li>
                                <li><strong>Burning rubber smell:</strong> Belt slipping on pulleys</li>
                                <li><strong>Longer dry times:</strong> Belt slipping = slower drum speed</li>

                                <li><strong>Online Parts Retailers:</strong> PartSelect, RepairClinic, Amazon</li>
                                <li><strong>Local Appliance Parts Stores:</strong> Reliable Parts, AM-RAD, Marcone</li>
                                <li><strong>Big Box Stores:</strong> Home Depot, Lowe's (limited selection)</li>

                            <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Belt Replacement</h2>

                            <p>These instructions cover most standard dryers. Your model may vary slightly.</p>

                            <div class="warning-box">
                                <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Safety First</h4>
                                <p>Always unplug the dryer or turn off the circuit breaker before beginning. For gas dryers, also turn off the gas supply valve. Never work on a dryer that's connected to power.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h3>Step 1: Disconnect Power and Access</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Unplug the dryer from the wall outlet</li>
                                <li>For gas dryers, turn off the gas valve</li>
                                <li>Pull the dryer away from the wall for access</li>
                                <li>Remove the lint filter</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Step 2: Remove the Top Panel</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Locate the clips holding the top panel (usually at the front corners)</li>
                                <li>Insert a putty knife between the top and front panels</li>
                                <li>Push in to release the spring clips</li>
                                <li>Lift the top panel and prop it up or lean it against the wall</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Step 3: Remove the Front Panel</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Disconnect the door switch wiring harness (take a photo first)</li>
                                <li>Remove the screws holding the front panel (usually 2-4 screws at top)</li>
                                <li>Some models have screws at the bottom as well</li>
                                <li>Lift the front panel slightly and pull toward you</li>
                                <li>Set the front panel aside</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Step 4: Remove the Broken Belt</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Take a photo of the belt routing for reference</li>
                                <li>Reach under the drum and locate the idler pulley</li>
                                <li>Push the idler pulley toward the motor to release tension</li>
                                <li>Slip the belt off the idler and motor pulleys</li>
                                <li>Remove the old belt from around the drum</li>
                                <li>Inspect the old belt - note how it was installed</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Step 5: Inspect Other Components</h3>

                            <p>While you have access, check these components:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Idler Pulley:</strong> Spin it by hand - should turn smoothly and quietly</li>
                                <li><strong>Motor Pulley:</strong> Check for cracks or wear</li>
                                <li><strong>Drum Rollers:</strong> Spin them - should rotate freely</li>
                                <li><strong>Drum Glides:</strong> Check the felt pads at the front of the drum</li>
                            </ul>

                            <div class="tip-box">
                                <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Pro Tip</h4>
                                <p>If the idler pulley doesn't spin freely or makes noise, replace it now. It's much easier to replace while the dryer is apart than to do this job twice.</p>
                            </div>

                            <h3>Step 6: Install the New Belt</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Loop the new belt around the drum with the grooved/ribbed side against the drum</li>
                                <li>Position the belt in the center of the drum</li>
                                <li>Reach under the drum and thread the belt through the idler pulley</li>
                                <li>Push the idler toward the motor to create slack</li>
                                <li>Loop the belt around the motor pulley</li>
                                <li>Release the idler - spring tension should tighten the belt</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Step 7: Reassemble the Dryer</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Spin the drum by hand to verify the belt is tracking correctly</li>
                                <li>Reinstall the front panel and secure with screws</li>
                                <li>Reconnect the door switch wiring</li>
                                <li>Lower and snap the top panel into place</li>
                                <li>Reinstall the lint filter</li>
                                <li>Push the dryer back into position</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Step 8: Test the Repair</h3>

                            <ol>
                                <li>Plug in the dryer (and turn on gas if applicable)</li>
                                <li>Run the dryer empty for 5 minutes</li>
                                <li>Listen for any unusual sounds</li>
                                <li>Check that the drum is spinning smoothly</li>
                                <li>Test with a small load of clothes</li>
                            </ol>

                                    <h3>How do I know if my dryer belt is broken?</h3>
                                    <p>The most obvious sign is that the motor runs (you hear humming) but the drum doesn't spin. If you open the door and can spin the drum very easily by hand with almost no resistance, the belt is broken. You might also find pieces of black rubber inside the dryer.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="faq-item">
                                    <h3>How long does a dryer belt last?</h3>
                                    <p>A dryer belt typically lasts 10-15 years under normal use. However, factors like overloading, running the dryer while unlevel, or having a restricted vent can shorten belt life. If you hear squealing or thumping sounds, your belt may be wearing out and due for replacement.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="faq-item">
                                    <h3>Can I run a dryer with a broken belt?</h3>
                                    <p>No, you should not run a dryer with a broken belt. The belt is essential for turning the drum - without it, clothes won't tumble and won't dry. Additionally, running the motor without a load could cause it to overheat. Replace the belt before using the dryer again.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="faq-item">
                                    <h3>Are all dryer belts the same?</h3>
                                    <p>No, dryer belts vary by brand and model. They differ in length (typically 84-93 inches), width, and type (flat vs. multi-rib). Always order a belt specific to your dryer's model number for proper fit and function.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="faq-item">
                                    <h3>How hard is it to replace a dryer belt?</h3>
                                    <p>Replacing a dryer belt is considered a moderate DIY project. It requires basic tools and typically takes 30-45 minutes. The most challenging part is threading the belt through the idler pulley system. Most homeowners with basic mechanical ability can complete this repair.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="faq-item">
                                    <h3>Should I replace the idler pulley when replacing the belt?</h3>
                                    <p>It's recommended if the idler pulley shows any signs of wear (wobbles, doesn't spin freely, or makes noise). Since you already have the dryer apart, replacing the $15-25 idler pulley now can prevent another breakdown soon. It's a common point of failure.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="faq-item">
                                    <h3>Why does my dryer squeal after I replaced the belt?</h3>
                                    <p>A slight squeal after belt replacement is normal and usually stops after a few drying cycles as the belt breaks in. If it persists, check that the belt is installed with the grooved side against the drum, the idler pulley spins freely, and the belt is properly tensioned.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>How much should I pay for a dryer belt replacement?</h3>
                                    <p>If you DIY, expect to pay $15-40 for the belt. Professional repair typically costs $120-200 total, including parts and labor. For older dryers worth less than $300, DIY repair makes the most financial sense.</p>
