# Vercel Deployment Setup Guide
**For Automated Blog Publishing (Oct 31 - Nov 4, 2025)**

---

## Overview

Since you're using **Vercel for hosting**, the publishing workflow is:

1. **GitHub Actions** ‚Üí Publishes 1 post to `/blog/troubleshooting/` and commits to GitHub
2. **GitHub Auto-Deploys to Vercel** ‚Üí Vercel detects the commit and rebuilds/deploys
3. **Posts Live** ‚Üí New posts immediately available on your site

**No Vercel secrets needed** - Your GitHub repository is already connected to Vercel!

---

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ **You Already Have:**
- Vercel connected to GitHub repository
- vercel.json configured with rewrites
- Git repository set up
- GitHub Actions enabled

‚úÖ **Verify:**
- Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Your project
- Confirm "Git" shows "NikaApplianceRepair" repository
- Confirm "Auto-deploy" is ON for main branch

---

## Step 1: Verify GitHub Access Token (Usually Already Set)

Vercel automatically deploys when commits are pushed to `main` branch.

**Check GitHub Actions permissions:**
1. Go to GitHub repository Settings
2. Click "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Confirm `GITHUB_TOKEN` exists (it's built-in, no setup needed)

---

## Step 2: Configure Slack Notifications (Optional)

If you want notifications when posts publish:

**Create Slack Webhook:**
1. Go to Slack Workspace Settings
2. Click "Manage Apps" ‚Üí "Custom Integrations" ‚Üí "Incoming Webhooks"
3. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
4. Select channel (e.g., #blog or #publishing)
5. Copy the webhook URL

**Add to GitHub Secrets:**
1. Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
4. Value: (paste your webhook URL)

**Note:** Slack notifications in the workflow are optional (continue-on-error: true)

---

## Step 3: Test the Workflow (Manual Trigger)

Before October 31, test the workflow:

**Manual Test:**
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Select "Auto-Publish Blog Posts" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click green "Run workflow"

**What to expect:**
- Workflow runs within 1 minute
- 1 post is published from `day-1` folder
- Commit appears in GitHub
- Vercel auto-deploys (takes 1-2 minutes)
- Post appears on your website at `/blog/troubleshooting/[slug]`

**Check Results:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí Workflow run
2. Look for green checkmark ‚úÖ
3. Check sitemap updated in commit
4. Visit your website, verify new post appears
5. Check Vercel deployment status (Deployments tab)

---

## Step 4: Verify Vercel Auto-Deployment

Vercel should automatically deploy every time you push to `main` branch.

**Verify Auto-Deployment:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Your project
2. Click "Settings" ‚Üí "Git"
3. Confirm "Auto-deploy on every push" is ON
4. Confirm branch is `main`

**What happens automatically:**
- GitHub Actions publishes 1 post and commits to `main`
- Vercel detects the commit
- Vercel rebuilds the site
- Site is live in 1-2 minutes

---

## Step 5: Understanding the Schedule

The workflow will run at these times:

**Oct 31 (Day 1) - 5 posts:**
- 6:00 AM UTC
- 9:00 AM UTC
- 12:00 PM UTC
- 3:00 PM UTC
- 6:00 PM UTC

**Nov 1 (Day 2) - 5 posts:**
- Same times (6 AM, 9 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, 6 PM UTC)

**Nov 2 (Day 3) - 5 posts:**
- Same times

**Nov 3 (Day 4) - 5 posts:**
- Same times

**Nov 4 (Day 5) - 4 posts:**
- 6:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 3:00 PM UTC

**Time Zone Conversion:**
If you're in Eastern Time (ET):
- 6 AM UTC = 1-2 AM ET (depending on DST)
- 9 AM UTC = 4-5 AM ET
- 12 PM UTC = 7-8 AM ET
- 3 PM UTC = 10-11 AM ET
- 6 PM UTC = 1-2 PM ET

To change times, edit the cron expressions in `.github/workflows/auto-publish-blog.yml`

---

## Step 6: Monitor During Publishing Week

**Daily Monitoring Checklist:**

**Each Morning:**
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions for successful runs
- [ ] Verify post appears on website
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment status
- [ ] Monitor site performance

**Each Evening:**
- [ ] Check for any failed runs
- [ ] Verify all posts indexed in Google Search Console
- [ ] Monitor GA4 for new traffic
- [ ] Review Slack notifications (if configured)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Posts Not Publishing?

**Issue: Workflow failed in GitHub Actions**
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí "Auto-Publish Blog Posts"
2. Click the failed run
3. Expand the failed step (usually "Publish draft posts")
4. Read the error message
5. Common issues:
   - Day folder doesn't exist (check spelling)
   - File permissions issue
   - Path not found

**Fix:** Check the specific error, adjust workflow if needed, try manual run again

### Posts Published But Don't Appear on Website?

**Issue: Vercel deployment succeeded but post not visible**

1. Check Vercel build log:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
   - Click the latest deployment
   - Check build logs for errors

2. Possible causes:
   - CSS paths are wrong (../../css/)
   - Post file wasn't deployed
   - Browser cache issue
   - Rewrite rules not matching

3. Solutions:
   - Check post file exists: `/blog/troubleshooting/[filename].html`
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Check vercel.json rewrites include `/blog/:category/:slug`
   - Redeploy by pushing empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger redeploy"`

### Workflow Runs But No Commit?

**Issue: GitHub Actions says "No changes to commit"**

This means `day-X` folder is empty or all posts already published.

**Check:**
1. Verify draft posts exist: `/blog/_drafts/day-1/` should have 5 .html files
2. Check published log: `/blog/_published_log.json` to see what's already published
3. If all posts from a day are published, move to next day's folder
