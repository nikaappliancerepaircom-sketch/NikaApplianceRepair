🔊 What's That Noise? Washing Machine Edition

Your washer shouldn't sound like a helicopter! Here's what different sounds mean:

🔴 BANGING = Unbalanced load or worn shocks
🔴 GRINDING = Worn bearings (needs repair!)
🔴 SQUEAKING = Belt or pulley issue
🔴 CLICKING = Object stuck in drum
🔴 HUMMING = Motor or pump problem

Don't ignore these sounds - small issues become expensive repairs!

Free diagnosis with any repair.
