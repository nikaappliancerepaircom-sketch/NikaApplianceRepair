# Brand Pages Template Analysis

## Current Situation:

### 1. **Issues Found:**
- The index.html has HTML errors (missing `<section` tags on lines 1043 and 1140)
- The LG page has the CORRECT HTML structure but different content organization
- The areas section structure differs between pages:
  - Index: Simple grid with `area-item` divs + `areas-features` section
  - LG: Grouped structure with `area-group` divs (more organized but different)

### 2. **Key Differences to Address:**

#### Areas Section:
- **Index page**: Uses simple flat grid of areas with features section at bottom
- **LG page**: Uses grouped areas by region (Toronto Districts, West GTA, etc.)
- **Decision**: The template should match the index page structure for consistency

#### Missing Sections:
- The LG page is missing the FAQ and Contact sections that exist on the homepage
- These have been added to the brand template

### 3. **Template Created:**
- Complete brand template created at: `brands/brand-template.html`
- Instructions file created at: `brands/templates/brand-template-instructions.md`
- Brand configurations created at: `brands/templates/brand-configs.js`

### 4. **Next Steps:**

1. **Fix the areas section** in brand-template.html to match index structure
2. **Create brand pages** for Samsung, Whirlpool, and GE using the template
3. **Update the LG page** to include missing FAQ and Contact sections
4. **Fix HTML errors** in index.html (missing section tags)

### 5. **Placeholders System:**
The template uses placeholders like [BRAND], [BRAND-URL], etc. that need to be replaced with actual brand values. See brand-configs.js for the values for each brand.
