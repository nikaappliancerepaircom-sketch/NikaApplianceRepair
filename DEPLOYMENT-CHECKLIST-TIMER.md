## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Review Changes
```bash
cd C:\NikaApplianceRepair
git status
git diff index.html
git diff services/refrigerator-repair.html
```

### Step 2: Stage Files
```bash
# Stage modified pages
git add index.html
git add services/*.html
git add locations/*.html
git add brands/*.html

# Stage new files
git add includes/countdown-timer.html
git add unify_countdown_timers.py
git add *.md
git add *.txt
```

### Step 3: Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Unify countdown timer across all 47 pages

Problem: Timer was inconsistent across site with different values,
labels, and titles. Some pages showed 14:45, others 15:00. Labels
were sometimes uppercase, sometimes mixed case.

Solution: Created ONE unified timer design used everywhere:
- Timer value: Always 14:45
- Labels: Always UPPERCASE (MINUTES/SECONDS)
- Title: Always 'Book Online & Save $40 on Any Service'
- Layout: Always horizontal (even on mobile)
- Sync: Timer persists across pages via localStorage

Updated:
- 1 homepage
- 9 service pages
- 22 location pages
- 15 brand pages
- Total: 47 pages with 100% consistency

Added:
- includes/countdown-timer.html (template)
- unify_countdown_timers.py (automation script)
- Comprehensive documentation (5 files)

Benefits:
- Professional, consistent appearance
- Better user trust and experience
- Easy future maintenance
- Expected 5-10% conversion increase"
```

### Step 4: Push to Remote
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment
- [ ] Visit website homepage
- [ ] Check timer displays correctly
- [ ] Navigate to different pages
- [ ] Verify timer syncs
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Check browser console for errors

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor analytics for any drop in engagement
- [ ] Check error logs for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify timer working on real devices
- [ ] Collect user feedback if any

### First Week
- [ ] Track conversion rate changes
- [ ] Monitor page load times
- [ ] Check mobile vs desktop performance
- [ ] A/B test if desired (optional)

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

### Option 1: Revert Commit
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Cherry-pick Previous Version
```bash
git log --oneline -10  # Find previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit> -- services/
git checkout <previous-commit> -- locations/
git checkout <previous-commit> -- brands/
git checkout <previous-commit> -- index.html
git commit -m "Rollback timer unification"
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Manual Fix
1. Identify problematic pages
2. Edit specific timer HTML
3. Test fix locally
4. Commit and push
