### ❌ FAILING GATES (2/10)

#### 1. SEO + AI Optimization: 82.2% (37/45) ❌ FAIL
**Target:** 85%+ required

**Issues:**
- Title tag length 62 chars (target: 50-60) - Line 7
- Too many location mentions: 88 (target: 15-40, currently oversaturated)
- H2 count: 13 (target: 5-10)
- H3 count: 29 (target: 12-15)
- Image count: 9 (target: 10+)
- Question headers (H3 with ?): 1 (target: 6+)
- Non-HTTPS references found

**Action Items:**
1. Reduce "Brampton" mentions from 88 to 30-35 maximum
2. Consolidate H2/H3 hierarchy
3. Add 1-2 more images with alt text
4. Convert more H2/H3 to question format
5. Ensure all references use HTTPS

---

#### 2. ⚠️ Content Quality: 93.3% (14/15) ❌ CRITICAL FAIL
**Target:** 98%+ REQUIRED (CRITICAL GATE)

**Critical Issue:**
- Word count: 4,748 words (target: 1,500-2,500)
- Content is TOO LONG - needs 47% reduction

**Why This Matters:**
- Google penalizes overly long location pages (seen as keyword stuffing)
- User engagement drops after 2,500 words
- Page load time increases
- Mobile users abandon long pages

**Action Items:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Reduce content from 4,748 to 2,200 words max (remove ~2,500 words)
2. Keep Brampton-specific content (large family, smart home, hard water, builder-grade)
3. Shorten FAQ answers (currently too verbose)
4. Remove redundant explanations
5. Consolidate similar sections

**Sections to Trim:**
- FAQ answers too detailed (lines 1425-1586) - cut by 40%
- Common problems section verbose (lines 1122-1182) - cut by 30%
- Services section (lines 637-793) - cut by 20%

**What to Keep (Unique Content):**
- Large family specialists content ✅
- Smart home appliance expertise ✅
- 1960s electrical system knowledge ✅
- Hard water + heavy usage solutions ✅
- Builder-grade appliance repair ✅

---

#### 3. ⚠️ Data Consistency: 93.3% (14/15) ❌ CRITICAL FAIL
**Target:** 100% REQUIRED (CRITICAL GATE)

**CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND:**

**Line 903:** ❌ **UNAUTHORIZED MANUFACTURER CLAIM**
```html
<li><span class="feature-icon">✓</span> Factory-authorized for major brands</li>
```

**Why This Is Critical:**
- False advertising - you are NOT factory-authorized
- Legal liability (manufacturer lawsuits)
- Consumer protection violation
- Immediate removal required

**Correct Language:**
- ✅ "Experienced with all major brands"
- ✅ "We service all major brands"
- ✅ "Certified technicians for major brands"
- ❌ "Factory-authorized" (ILLEGAL without written agreements)

**Fix Required:**
```html
<!-- REMOVE Line 903 -->
<li><span class="feature-icon">✓</span> Factory-authorized for major brands</li>

<!-- REPLACE WITH -->
<li><span class="feature-icon">✓</span> Experienced with all major brands</li>
```
