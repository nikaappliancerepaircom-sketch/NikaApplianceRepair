## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical):
1. **Twitter Descriptions:** Initially had Richmond Hill references, fixed via batch Python script
2. **Word Count Tool:** Counts HTML words (6,600+) vs. actual content words (~1,900-2,100)
3. **Template Dependencies:** Any future updates to Richmond Hill template require manual propagation

### Limitations by Design:
1. **Generic Problem #3:** Third problem card kept generic for all cities (consistent messaging)
2. **Universal Services:** No city-specific services added (maintains consistency)
3. **Same Pricing:** All cities have identical pricing (business decision)
4. **No Images:** No city-specific images added yet (future enhancement)

### Future Considerations:
1. **Seasonal Content:** May want to add seasonal tips per city (winter prep in Durham vs. summer in Halton)
2. **Neighborhood Subpages:** High-volume cities (Mississauga, Brampton) may benefit from neighborhood-specific subpages
3. **Customer Reviews:** Add city-specific review sections with actual customer testimonials
4. **Local Partnerships:** Consider adding local water treatment company partnerships for hard water cities
