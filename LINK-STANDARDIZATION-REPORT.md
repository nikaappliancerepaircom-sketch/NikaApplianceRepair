# Internal Link Standardization Report

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Task:** Standardize all internal link formats to use consistent relative paths

## Objective

Convert all internal links from absolute paths (starting with `/`) to relative paths for consistency across the website, while preserving:
- `/blog` links (for clean URLs)
- Anchor links (`/#testimonials`, `/#faq`, etc.)
- External links (`https://...`)
- Home link (`href="/"`)
- CSS/JS file references

## Changes Made

### 1. Automated Script Execution

Created and executed `scripts/standardize-internal-links.py` which:
- Processed 55 HTML files across the site
- Made 81 replacements across 4 main files
- Converted patterns:
  - `/services/...` → `services/...` (root level) or `../services/...` (subdirectories)
  - `/locations/...` → `locations/...` (root level) or `../locations/...` (subdirectories)
  - `/brands/...` → `brands/...` (root level) or `../brands/...` (subdirectories)
  - `/book` → `book` (root level) or `../book` (subdirectories)
  - `/about` → `about` (root level) or `../about` (subdirectories)

### 2. Include Files Updated

Manually updated shared include files that are loaded dynamically:

#### `includes/header.html`
- Updated navigation links to use relative paths
- Converted `/services`, `/locations`, `/about` → `services`, `locations`, `about`
- Converted `/book` → `book`
- Kept `href="/"` for home link (correct)

#### `includes/footer.html`
- Updated all service links: `/services/...` → `services/...`
- Updated all location links: `/locations/...` → `locations/...`
- Updated company links: `/about` → `about`
- Updated utility links: `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/sitemap.xml` → relative paths
- Kept anchor links (`/#testimonials`, `/#faq`) as-is (correct)

### 3. Blog Post Fixed

Updated `blog/troubleshooting/refrigerator-not-cooling-toronto.html`:
- Converted `/services/...` → `../../services/...` (2 levels up)
- Converted `/book` → `../../book` (2 levels up)
- Converted `/about` → `../../about` (2 levels up)

## Files Modified Summary

### Root Level Files (4 files changed)
- `blog.html` - 6 replacements
- `brands.html` - 19 replacements
- Other root files already had correct relative paths

### Location Pages (2 files changed)
- `locations/toronto.html` - 28 replacements
- `locations/stouffville.html` - 28 replacements
- Other location pages already had correct relative paths

### Brand Pages
- All brand pages already had correct relative paths (using `../` prefix)

### Service Pages
- All service pages already had correct relative paths

### Blog Posts (1 file changed)
- `blog/troubleshooting/refrigerator-not-cooling-toronto.html` - Fixed

### Include Files (2 files changed)
- `includes/header.html` - Updated navigation and CTA links
- `includes/footer.html` - Updated all footer links

## Verification Results

Ran comprehensive verification script (`scripts/verify-link-standardization.py`):

### Production Files: ✓ ALL CLEAN
- 0 issues in production HTML files
- All website pages use consistent relative paths

### Non-Production Files: 2 files with absolute paths (IGNORED)
- `reports/seo/index.html` - SEO report (not a public page)
- `src/components/footer.html` - Source component (not in production)

## Path Patterns Used

### Root Level Pages (`index.html`, `services.html`, `locations.html`, `brands.html`, `blog.html`, `about.html`, `book.html`)
```html
<a href="services/refrigerator-repair">Refrigerator Repair</a>
<a href="locations/toronto">Toronto</a>
<a href="brands/samsung-appliance-repair-toronto">Samsung</a>
<a href="book">Book Now</a>
<a href="about">About Us</a>
```

### Service Pages (`services/*.html`)
```html
<a href="../services/refrigerator-repair">Refrigerator Repair</a>
<a href="../locations/toronto">Toronto</a>
<a href="../brands/samsung-appliance-repair-toronto">Samsung</a>
<a href="../book">Book Now</a>
<a href="../about">About Us</a>
```

### Location Pages (`locations/*.html`)
```html
<a href="../services/refrigerator-repair">Refrigerator Repair</a>
<a href="../locations/toronto">Toronto</a>
<a href="../brands/samsung-appliance-repair-toronto">Samsung</a>
<a href="../book">Book Now</a>
<a href="../about">About Us</a>
```

### Brand Pages (`brands/*.html`)
```html
<a href="../services/refrigerator-repair">Refrigerator Repair</a>
<a href="../locations/toronto">Toronto</a>
<a href="../brands/samsung-appliance-repair-toronto">Samsung</a>
<a href="../book">Book Now</a>
<a href="../about">About Us</a>
```

### Blog Posts (`blog/*/*.html`)
```html
<a href="../../services/refrigerator-repair">Refrigerator Repair</a>
<a href="../../locations/toronto">Toronto</a>
<a href="../../book">Book Now</a>
<a href="../../about">About Us</a>
```

## Exceptions Preserved

The following patterns were intentionally kept as absolute paths:

1. **Home Link**: `href="/"` - Standard convention for home page
2. **Anchor Links**: `href="/#testimonials"`, `href="/#faq"` - Links to sections on home page
3. **Blog Links**: `href="/blog/..."` - Preserved for clean URL structure (as requested)
4. **External Links**: `href="https://..."` - Unchanged
5. **Resources**: `src="/assets/..."`, `href="/css/..."` - Unchanged

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Consistency**: All internal links now follow the same pattern
2. **Portability**: Site can be moved to subdirectory without link breakage
3. **Predictability**: Developers can easily understand link structure
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and manage navigation
5. **SEO-Friendly**: Relative paths work better with different deployment scenarios

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing**: Click through key navigation paths:
   - From homepage → services, locations, brands
   - From service pages → other pages
   - From location pages → other pages
   - From brand pages → other pages

2. **Automated Testing**: Run the verification script periodically:
   ```bash
   python scripts/verify-link-standardization.py
   ```

3. **Browser Testing**: Test on different browsers to ensure all links work

## Tools Created

1. **scripts/standardize-internal-links.py** - Automated conversion script
2. **scripts/verify-link-standardization.py** - Verification and validation script

Both scripts are reusable and can be run anytime to check or fix links.

## Status

✓ **COMPLETE** - All production files have been standardized to use consistent relative paths.

**Total Changes**: 81+ replacements across 7 production files
**Total Files Verified**: 105 HTML files
**Issues Remaining**: 0 (in production files)
