# Topical Authority & Internal Linking Strategy
## Building Domain Authority Through Keyword Clustering

**Date Created:** October 30, 2025
**Total Blog Posts:** 20 new posts + 15 existing posts = **35 total authority-building posts**
**Strategy Goal:** Build topical clusters that dominate appliance repair keywords in Toronto

---

## 1. TOPICAL AUTHORITY CONCEPT

**What is Topical Authority?**
- Google rewards websites that comprehensively cover entire topics
- A cluster of 10-15 related posts about the same topic = authority signal
- Proper internal linking tells Google: "This website is an expert on appliance repair"
- Result: Higher rankings for main keyword + all related keywords

**Our 3-Cluster Strategy:**
1. **General Repair Cluster** (7 posts) - Establish baseline authority
2. **Brand-Specific Cluster** (3 posts) - Dominate brand search terms
3. **Geographic Cluster** (5 posts) - Own local service area keywords
4. **Emergency/Urgency Cluster** (5 posts) - Capture high-intent keywords

## 4. LINKING RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### **Rule 1: Contextual Linking**
✅ Link within body paragraphs (not just footer)
✅ Use 2-4 word anchor text (not "click here", not entire sentence)
✅ Match anchor text to target post topic

**Example:**
```
"Your washing machine not draining? Check out our complete guide to
washing machine repair which covers hard water issues specific to Toronto."

Anchor text: "washing machine repair guide"
```

### **Rule 2: Link Distribution**
✅ Hub posts: 6-10 outbound links (to satellites)
✅ Satellite posts: 2-4 links back (to hub + related)
✅ Each post: 5-10 internal links total
✅ Avoid: >12 links per post (dilutes authority)

### **Rule 3: Anchor Text Variation**
❌ DON'T: "refrigerator repair", "refrigerator repair", "refrigerator repair" (exact match overload)
✅ DO: Mix anchors
- 40% exact match: "refrigerator repair"
- 30% partial match: "fridge repair in Toronto", "professional refrigerator service"
- 20% branded: "Nika appliance repair"
- 10% generic: "learn more", "read our guide"

### **Rule 4: Link Frequency**
✅ Link to same post: Max 2x per article
✅ Link to different posts: Vary distribution
✅ Internal links: 1-2 per 500 words

### **Rule 5: Linking Direction**
✅ Hub posts: Link OUT to satellites (pass authority to cluster)
✅ Satellite posts: Link IN to hub (consolidate authority)
✅ Lateral links: Related satellites link to each other (cluster strength)
