content = content.replace(old_faq_2_question, new_faq_2_question)

old_faq_2_answer = '''<p><strong>Absolutely — heritage home appliances are one of our core specialties!</strong> Toronto's historic neighborhoods (Cabbagetown, Leslieville, The Annex, Riverdale, The Beaches, Parkdale, Bloor West Village, Rosedale) contain thousands of homes built between 1880-1930. These architectural treasures present distinct appliance challenges:</p>
                        <p><strong>Electrical constraints:</strong> Most run 60-100 amp service (modern standard is 200 amps), some still have knob-and-tube wiring in walls, limited circuits means appliances compete for power.</p>
                        <p><strong>Physical access issues:</strong> Narrow Victorian staircases (often 30-32" wide), tight doorways and hallways limit appliance size, basement laundry rooms with low ceilings (6-7 feet).</p>
                        <p><strong>Our heritage-home expertise:</strong> We've repaired appliances in 500+ Toronto heritage properties. We know how to assess electrical capacity before recommending replacements, measure access points before delivery, suggest creative venting solutions, and recommend Energy Star appliances that work with limited electrical service.</p>
                        <p><strong>Historic neighborhoods we serve weekly:</strong> Cabbagetown, Old Town, The Annex, Rosedale, Forest Hill, Leslieville, Riverdale, The Beaches, Parkdale, Bloor West Village, High Park area, The Kingsway</p>'''

new_faq_2_answer = '''<p><strong>Absolutely — large family appliance challenges are our PRIMARY specialty in Brampton!</strong> Brampton has the LARGEST average household size in the entire GTA at 3.6 people per home (vs 2.4 in Toronto). This creates unique appliance stress that standard technicians don't understand.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why Brampton appliances fail faster:</strong> Large families (4-6+ people) run washers 1-2x daily vs typical 4-5x weekly. Dryers operate constantly (no time for line drying between loads). Dishwashers run 1-2x daily (vs 4x weekly typical). Refrigerators opened 50-100 times daily vs 30-40 times in small households. Ovens/stoves used for large-batch cooking (wear accelerates).</p>
                        <p><strong>Real-world impact:</strong> Appliance rated for 10 years fails at year 6-7. Washers develop bearing issues from constant heavy loads. Dryers burn through heating elements 40% faster. Dishwasher pumps fail from overuse combined with hard water. Refrigerator compressors work overtime keeping up with constant door opening.</p>
                        <p><strong>Our large-family expertise:</strong> We've repaired appliances in 1,000+ Brampton large-family homes. We understand: Which components fail first under heavy use, How to replace with HEAVY-DUTY commercial-grade parts rated for higher usage, Maintenance schedules to prevent premature failure, When to recommend commercial-grade appliances (some families need commercial dishwashers rated for 3x daily use), Cost-benefit of repair vs replacement for heavy-use scenarios.</p>
                        <p><strong>Large-family neighborhoods we serve weekly:</strong> Bramalea (both North & South), Springdale, Heart Lake, Professor's Lake, Mount Pleasant, Sandalwood, Castlemore, Countryside Village, Fletcher's Meadow</p>
                        <p><strong>Pro tip for Brampton families:</strong> Schedule preventive maintenance every 12-18 months. Prevents 60% of heavy-use failures. We offer large-family maintenance packages: $149/year covers washer, dryer, and dishwasher inspection + cleaning.</p>'''

old_faq_3_question = '<span>What experience do you have with appliances in Toronto condo buildings?</span>'
new_faq_3_question = '<span>Can you safely repair appliances in Brampton homes with 1960s-70s electrical systems?</span>'
content = content.replace(old_faq_3_question, new_faq_3_question)

old_faq_3_answer = '''<p><strong>Condo appliance repair represents 40% of our Toronto business</strong> — we work in high-rises daily. Toronto has 1,000+ condo buildings, each with unique characteristics:</p>
                        <p><strong>Older condos (1970s-1990s):</strong> Buildings in St. James Town, CityPlace (older towers), Harbourfront, North York Centre feature compact appliances in tight kitchen spaces, original appliances often 20-30+ years old, shared building systems affecting water pressure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Modern condos (2000s-2020s):</strong> Buildings in King West, Liberty Village, Entertainment District, Yorkville showcase European compact brands (Bosch, Blomberg, Miele, Fisher & Paykel), integrated/built-in appliances custom to cabinets, stacked washer-dryers in closets or bathrooms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Building coordination expertise:</strong> We navigate Toronto condo requirements professionally: book freight elevator time with property management, obtain move-in/move-out certificates when required, coordinate with building superintendents, work within condo board-mandated hours (typically 9 AM - 5 PM weekdays).</p>
                        <p><strong>Condo buildings we service regularly:</strong> King West towers, Liberty Village complexes, CityPlace buildings, Harbourfront condos, Yorkville high-rises, North York Centre towers, Yonge & Eglinton area, Bayview Village condos</p>
                        <p><strong>Booking tip for condo residents:</strong> Schedule weekday morning appointments (9-11 AM) to avoid freight elevator conflicts with move-ins and deliveries.</p>'''

new_faq_3_answer = '''<p><strong>Yes — 1960s-70s electrical system expertise is CRITICAL in Brampton!</strong> South Bramalea was heavily developed in the 1960s-1970s boom. These homes have 60-amp or 100-amp electrical panels (modern code requires 200 amps). This is one of Brampton's most common appliance challenges.</p>
                        <p><strong>The electrical problem:</strong> 1960s-70s panels were designed for small appliances (refrigerator, range, minimal lighting). Today's families run: Large refrigerator (8-10 amps), Dishwasher (10-12 amps), Microwave (10-15 amps), Washer (15 amps), Dryer (30 amps), Plus modern lighting, computers, TVs, phones charging. Total electrical load EXCEEDS panel capacity. Circuit breakers trip frequently. Appliances shut off mid-cycle. Lights dim when appliances start.</p>
                        <p><strong>Affected Brampton neighborhoods:</strong> South Bramalea (highest concentration - built 1960s), North Bramalea sections (early 1970s), Queen Street West corridor, Castlemore older sections, Downtown Brampton (pre-1970 homes), Kennedy Corridor areas</p>
                        <p><strong>Our safe approach to insufficient electrical:</strong> First, we test your appliance thoroughly to rule out appliance failure. Second, we measure actual electrical capacity at your panel using professional equipment. Third, we determine if issue is appliance OR electrical. If electrical insufficient: We recommend energy-efficient appliance replacements that draw 30-40% less power (modern refrigerators use 40% less electricity than 2000s models), Install dedicated circuits where possible without full panel upgrade, Coordinate with licensed electricians we trust for full panel upgrades ($2,000-$4,000 typically), Advise on load management (don't run washer + dryer + dishwasher simultaneously).</p>
                        <p><strong>Important safety note:</strong> We NEVER attempt repairs that could overload your electrical system. If your panel is insufficient, we'll honestly tell you. Many families can delay expensive panel upgrades by 3-5 years with energy-efficient appliances and smart load management.</p>
                        <p><strong>Brampton electrical upgrade resources:</strong> We partner with local licensed electricians who understand Brampton 1960s-70s homes. We can coordinate complete electrical + appliance upgrades. Typical timeline: Electrical panel upgrade (2 days) → Appliance installation (1 day) → Total cost: $4,000-$6,000 for panel + new energy-efficient appliances.</p>'''

old_faq_8 = '''<p><strong>Yes — post-war apartments represent 30% of our Toronto service calls!</strong> Toronto experienced massive apartment construction from 1950s-1980s, primarily in Scarborough, North York, York, and Etobicoke.</p>
                        <p><strong>Common building locations:</strong> Scarborough (hundreds of apartment towers throughout Victoria Park corridor, Kennedy Road, McCowan Road), North York (St. James Town - highest concentration in Canada, Thorncliffe Park, Flemingdon Park, Don Mills, Jane & Finch corridor), York (across the district), Etobicoke (Kipling Heights, Islington Avenue corridor, Rexdale area).</p>
                        <p><strong>Post-war building challenges:</strong> Building-wide water pressure (affects washers and dishwashers), common drain systems (backups affect multiple units), electrical limitations, laundry hookups added decades after construction, tight spaces for appliances, venting challenges, vibration concerns (shared walls/floors with neighbors).</p>
                        <p><strong>Our apartment building expertise:</strong> We've serviced hundreds of Toronto apartment buildings.

new_faq_8 = '''<p><strong>This is one of Brampton's BIGGEST appliance challenges!</strong> Brampton experienced massive subdivision construction 2000s-2020s. Builders installed budget "builder-grade" Frigidaire, Whirlpool, GE, and Maytag appliances rated for 8-10 years NORMAL use. Brampton's large families (3.6 people) create HEAVY use — your 10-year appliance fails at year 5-7.</p>
                        <p><strong>Why builder-grade fails faster in Brampton:</strong> Budget components (cheapest bearings, heating elements, pumps), Designed for 2-person household (4-5 loads weekly), Brampton families run 10-14 loads weekly (2x rated usage), Result: Premature failure at year 5-7 instead of 8-10, Thousands of Brampton homes hit this simultaneously as subdivisions age together (2005 builds all failing now in 2025).</p>
                        <p><strong>Most affected Brampton neighborhoods:</strong> Springdale (2000s-2010s builds), Credit Ridge (2010s), Northwest Brampton (2015-2020), Fletcher's Meadow (2000s), Heart Lake newer sections (2005-2015), Castlemore (2000s-2010s), Gore Meadows (2000s), Sandalwood (2005-2015)</p>
                        <p><strong>Our builder-grade expertise:</strong> We've repaired 3,000+ builder-grade appliances in Brampton. We understand: Which components fail first (bearings, pumps, heating elements, control boards), Cost-effective vs wasteful repairs (sometimes better to replace), How to UPGRADE failed components with commercial-grade parts that last longer, When repair makes sense vs replacement ($200 repair on $1,200 appliance = smart, $600 repair = replace instead).</p>
                        <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Frigidaire washer (2010 build) fails at year 7. Original bearing: $180 repair, lasts 3-5 years. Commercial-grade bearing: $280 repair, lasts 8-10 years. We recommend commercial upgrade — you get more lifespan.</p>
                        <p><strong>When to replace vs repair:</strong> Repair if: Appliance under 8 years old, Repair under $400, Only 1-2 components failed. Replace if: Appliance 10+ years old, Multiple components failing, Repair cost exceeds 50% of replacement. We give HONEST advice because we want repeat customers, not one-time upsells.</p>'''
