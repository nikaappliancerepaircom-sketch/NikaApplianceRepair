# Smart Template System Example

## How It Works

Instead of simple keyword replacement like:
- Replace [BRAND] with "Samsung"
- Replace [LOCATION] with "Toronto"

We generate **completely unique content** for each page based on context.

## Example: Creating Samsung Page vs LG Page

### LG Page Generation:
```javascript
{
  heroTitle: "We're the LG appliance repair experts that will fix your problem... FAST!",
  heroSubtitle: "Factory-trained technicians • Genuine LG parts • All LG models",
  expertise: "Linear Compressor Experts • Smart ThinQ Certified",
  
  commonProblems: [
    "Linear compressor failure (10-year warranty)",
    "Er IF error code (ice fan motor)",
    "OE drain error in washers",
    "d80/d90 vent blockage in dryers"
  ],
  
  uniqueFAQs: [
    "Do you fix LG Linear Compressor issues?",
    "Can you repair Smart ThinQ connectivity?"
  ]
}
```

### Samsung Page Generation:
```javascript
{
  heroTitle: "Toronto's Samsung appliance repair specialists you can trust",
  heroSubtitle: "Digital Inverter experts • Genuine Samsung parts • All models covered",
  expertise: "FlexWash Certified • Smart Home Ready",
  
  commonProblems: [
    "Ice maker freezing up (common design issue)",
    "DC error code (unbalanced load)",
    "Digital display going blank",
    "Twin Cooling system failures"
  ],
  
  uniqueFAQs: [
    "Can you fix Samsung ice maker problems?",
    "Do you service Digital Inverter technology?"
  ]
}
```

## Example: Service Pages

### Refrigerator Repair Page:
```javascript
{
  urgencyMessage: "🚨 Food at risk? We arrive in 45 minutes!",
  mainConcern: "preventing food spoilage",
  
  commonIssues: [
    "Not cooling properly",
    "Ice maker not working", 
    "Water leaking underneath",
    "Strange noises from compressor"
  ],
  
  averageCost: "$250-$450",
  
  maintenanceTips: [
    "Clean coils every 6 months",
    "Check door seals regularly",
    "Don't overload shelves"
  ]
}
```

### Washer Repair Page:
```javascript
{
  urgencyMessage: "👕 Laundry piling up? Same-day service!",
  mainConcern: "getting your laundry routine back",
  
  commonIssues: [
    "Won't drain water",
    "Not spinning properly",
    "Leaking during cycle",
    "Error codes displayed"
  ],
  
  averageCost: "$200-$400",
  
  maintenanceTips: [
    "Don't overload the drum",
    "Use proper detergent amount",
    "Clean filter monthly"
  ]
}
```
