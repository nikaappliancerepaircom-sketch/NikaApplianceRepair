# Smart Template System Example

## How It Works

Instead of simple keyword replacement like:
- Replace [BRAND] with "Samsung"
- Replace [LOCATION] with "Toronto"

We generate **completely unique content** for each page based on context.

## Example: Creating Samsung Page vs LG Page

### LG Page Generation:
```javascript
{
  heroTitle: "We're the LG appliance repair experts that will fix your problem... FAST!",
  heroSubtitle: "Factory-trained technicians â€¢ Genuine LG parts â€¢ All LG models",
  expertise: "Linear Compressor Experts â€¢ Smart ThinQ Certified",
  
  commonProblems: [
    "Linear compressor failure (10-year warranty)",
    "Er IF error code (ice fan motor)",
    "OE drain error in washers",
    "d80/d90 vent blockage in dryers"
  ],
  
  uniqueFAQs: [
    "Do you fix LG Linear Compressor issues?",
    "Can you repair Smart ThinQ connectivity?"
  ]
}
```

### Samsung Page Generation:
```javascript
{
  heroTitle: "Toronto's Samsung appliance repair specialists you can trust",
  heroSubtitle: "Digital Inverter experts â€¢ Genuine Samsung parts â€¢ All models covered",
  expertise: "FlexWash Certified â€¢ Smart Home Ready",
  
  commonProblems: [
    "Ice maker freezing up (common design issue)",
    "DC error code (unbalanced load)",
    "Digital display going blank",
    "Twin Cooling system failures"
  ],
  
  uniqueFAQs: [
    "Can you fix Samsung ice maker problems?",
    "Do you service Digital Inverter technology?"
  ]
}
```

## Example: Service Pages

### Refrigerator Repair Page:
```javascript
{
  urgencyMessage: "ðŸš¨ Food at risk? We arrive in 45 minutes!",
  mainConcern: "preventing food spoilage",
  
  commonIssues: [

    "Ice maker not working", 
    "Water leaking underneath",
    "Strange noises from compressor"
  ],
  
  averageCost: "$250-$450",

    "Clean coils every 6 months",
    "Check door seals regularly",
    "Don't overload shelves"
  ]
}
```

### Washer Repair Page:

```
