# AI-SEO Quick Implementation Guide for Context Engineering

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: AI Search is Taking Over (4% Daily Growth)

<h2>What Appliance Repair Services Are Available in Toronto?</h2>
<h3>How Do I Get My Refrigerator Fixed Today in Toronto?</h3>
```

### 2. Create Standalone Answer Paragraphs
```html
<!-- Every section needs a complete answer -->
<div class="ai-answer">
  <h3>How much does appliance repair cost in Toronto?</h3>
  <p>Appliance repair in Toronto costs $150-$400 on average. Nika Appliance Repair charges $80 for diagnostics (waived with repair), $150-$250 for minor repairs like belts or thermostats, and $250-$400 for major repairs like control boards or compressors. All repairs include a 90-day warranty and same-day service. Call 437-747-6737 for exact pricing.</p>
</div>
```
