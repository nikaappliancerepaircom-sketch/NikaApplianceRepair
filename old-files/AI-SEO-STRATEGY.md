# AI-First SEO Strategy for Context Engineering

## ü§ñ The AI Search Revolution - Critical Updates for Nika Appliance Repair

### Why This Matters NOW
- AI search adoption growing 4% daily
- 100% user interaction predicted by September 2024
- Most repair service websites are invisible to AI
- Early adopters will dominate local service searches

## 1. üèóÔ∏è Content Structure for AI Readability

### The "Answer Block" Method
Each paragraph must function as a complete, standalone answer that AI can extract.

#### Current Problem
Our content is too narrative and interconnected. AI can't extract clean answers.

#### Solution: Paragraph Templates

**For Service Pages:**
```markdown
## What causes a [appliance] to [problem]?
[Single paragraph with complete answer, 50-100 words]

## How much does [appliance] repair cost in Toronto?
[Complete pricing answer with ranges, 50-100 words]

## How long does [appliance] repair take?
[Complete time frame answer, 50-100 words]
```

**For Homepage Sections:**
```markdown
<!-- AI-Optimized Service Description -->
<div class="ai-answer-block">
  <h3>Emergency Appliance Repair in Toronto</h3>
  <p>Nika Appliance Repair provides same-day emergency repair service for all major appliances in Toronto and GTA. Our licensed technicians arrive within 45 minutes, diagnose the issue, and complete most repairs in under 2 hours.

</div>
```

### Heading Structure for AI
```html
<!-- OLD (Bad for AI) -->
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<h3>Refrigerators</h3>

<!-- NEW (AI-Optimized) -->
<h2>What Appliance Repair Services Does Nika Offer in Toronto?</h2>
<h3>How Do We Fix Broken Refrigerators in Toronto?</h3>
```

## 2. üèÜ Authority Signals Implementation
