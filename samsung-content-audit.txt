   Current: "Samsung appliance repair Toronto. Expert Samsung service for refrigerators, washers, dryers, dishwashers, ovens. Same-day, 90-day warranty. Save $40 on your first repair today! Call 437-747-6737 now"
   → Fix: Shorten to 150-160 chars

2. WHY CHOOSE US - Line 1456-1457
   ❌ SAYS "ALL BRANDS WELCOME"

   → Should: "Samsung-certified technicians specialized in all Samsung appliance models and series."

3. BENEFITS SECTION - Line 1436-1437
   ❌ GENERIC "Certified Appliance Repair Experts"
   Current: "Factory-trained, licensed, and insured technicians..."
   → Should: "Samsung Factory-Certified Technicians with specialized training on Family Hub, FlexWash, and all Samsung appliance technologies"

4. SERVICES SECTION
   ❌ Generic services (refrigerator, washer, dryer)
   → Should list Samsung-SPECIFIC models:
     - Samsung Family Hub refrigerators
     - Samsung FlexWash & FlexDry systems
     - Samsung Chef Collection ranges
     - Samsung Smart Dishwashers
     - Samsung French Door fridges
     - Samsung Bespoke series

5. COMMON ISSUES SECTION (if exists)

   → Should be Samsung-SPECIFIC problems:
     - Family Hub touchscreen not responding
     - Ice maker freezing over (Samsung RF28HMEDBSR)
     - FlexWash VRT error codes
     - Samsung washer DC error code
     - Samsung dryer not heating
     - Samsung fridge not cooling

6. ABOUT SECTION - Line 1496-1499
   ❌ NO SAMSUNG MENTION
   Current: "Since 2019, our appliance repair team..."
   → Should add: "Our technicians are Samsung-certified with specialized training at Samsung Service Academy. We service all Samsung appliance series..."

7. FAQ SECTION
   ❌ Generic FAQ questions
   → Should be Samsung-SPECIFIC:
     - "How much does Samsung refrigerator repair cost in Toronto?"
     - "Do you service Samsung Family Hub refrigerators?"
     - "Can you fix Samsung washer error codes?"
     - "Do you have genuine Samsung OEM parts?"

8. HOURS CONSISTENCY (BMAD CRITICAL FAILURE)
   ❌ Multiple conflicting hours:
     - Schema: Mon-Fri 8AM-8PM, Sat 9AM-6PM, Sun 10AM-5PM
     - Text mentions: "24/7", "8AM-8PM", "10 AM - 5 PM", "9 AM - 6 PM"
   → Fix: Choose ONE consistent hour (recommend: "24/7 Emergency Service")

9. KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION
   ❌ Page optimized for "appliance repair Toronto" (generic)
   → Should optimize for:
     - "Samsung appliance repair Toronto" (primary)
     - "Samsung refrigerator repair"
     - "Samsung washer repair"
     - "Samsung Family Hub repair"
     - "Samsung certified technician"
     - Target density: 1.5-2.5%

10. IMAGE ALT TEXT (need to check)
    ❌ Probably says "appliance technician"
    → Should say "Samsung appliance repair technician"

11. INTERNAL LINKS
    ❌ Links to generic service pages
    → Should emphasize Samsung-specific content and cross-link to other Samsung services
