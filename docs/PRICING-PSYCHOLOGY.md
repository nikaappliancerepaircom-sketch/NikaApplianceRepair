# Pricing Psychology & Strategy Guide

## 💰 Psychological Pricing Tactics

### 1. CHARM PRICING
**Never use round numbers**
- ❌ $200 → ✅ $197
- ❌ $150 → ✅ $147
- ❌ $99 → ✅ $97 (avoid overused 99)

### 2. ANCHOR PRICING DISPLAY
Show prices in this order:
```
Refrigerator Repair Pricing:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
New Refrigerator Cost: $1,299 ❌
Other Companies: $350-500 🤔
Our Repair Service: $197 ✅
You Save: $1,102! 🎉
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 3. BUNDLING PSYCHOLOGY
Create value perception:
- "Repair + Tune-up: $247" (saves $50)
- "Fix 2 Appliances: Save $75"
- "Annual Maintenance Plan: 3 repairs included"

### 4. PAYMENT FRAMING
Present costs in relatable terms:
- "Less than 2 tanks of gas"
- "Costs less than one restaurant dinner"
- "$6/day for 30 days" (vs $180 total)
- "1/10th the cost of replacement"
## 🏷️ Appliance Repair Pricing Strategy

### Diagnostic Fee Psychology
```
Standard Diagnostic: $119
"But wait... it's FREE with any repair!"

This creates:
- Commitment (they paid for diagnosis)
- Value perception (saving $119)
- Trust (we charge for expertise)
```

### The $40 OFF Sweet Spot
**Why $40 works better than $50:**
- Not too round (seems calculated)
- Substantial but believable
- Better than competitors ($20-30)
- Easy mental math

### Price Display Formulas

#### Service Pages:
```
Refrigerator Repair Starting at $150
- Average repair: $279
- With $40 OFF: $239
- FREE diagnostic included
- You save: $159 total!
```

#### Emergency Pages:
```
Emergency Diagnostic: $149
Regular Diagnostic: $119
Your Repair Includes: FREE Diagnostic
Instant Savings: $119-149!
```

### Exclusion Positioning
**Turn "We Don't" into Trust:**
```
"We DON'T repair microwaves or gas appliances.
Why? We focus on what we do best - major 
electric appliances. This specialization means
better service and lower prices for you!"
```

### Competitive Price Comparison
Always show three prices:
1. Replacement cost (highest)
2. Competitor repair cost (middle)
3. Our repair cost (lowest)

This uses the "Goldilocks Effect" - 
middle option makes ours look best.
