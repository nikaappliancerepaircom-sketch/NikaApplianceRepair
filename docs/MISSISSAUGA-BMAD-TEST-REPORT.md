## 4. CRITICAL FAILURES (6)

### Priority 1: MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY

#### 1. False Manufacturer Claims (CRITICAL)
**Line 903:** `<li><span class="feature-icon">✓</span> Factory-authorized for major brands</li>`

**Issue:** Claiming "Factory-authorized" without written agreements is false advertising.

**Fix:** Remove this line entirely OR change to:
```html
<li><span class="feature-icon">✓</span> Experienced with all major brands</li>
```

**Legal Risk:** HIGH - False advertising, potential lawsuits

---

#### 2. Warranty Inconsistency (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Mixed usage of "90-day" and "90 days" throughout page

**Occurrences:**
- "90-day" appears 7 times (Lines 6, 15, 22, 181, 273, 281, etc.)
- "90 days" appears 6 times (Lines 565, 572, 579, 586, 593, 600)

**Fix:** Replace ALL instances of "90 days" with "90-day" (hyphenated)

**Impact:** Inconsistency = unprofessional = trust loss

---

#### 3. Fake Urgency / Countdown Timer (CRITICAL)
**Lines 612-634:** Countdown timer section

**Issue:** Timer resets on page load, creating false scarcity

**Fix Option 1:** Remove countdown timer entirely
**Fix Option 2:** Replace with authentic urgency:
```html
<p>Book today for same-day service - Limited afternoon slots available</p>
```

**Impact:** Fake urgency damages brand trust permanently

---

#### 4. Data Consistency - Response Time Conflict (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** Page promises both "same-day" and "2-hour" response

**Occurrences:**
- "Same-day" messaging throughout
- "2-hour response" in specific sections

**Fix:** Choose ONE promise and use consistently:
- Recommended: "Same-day service" + "30-45 minute response time to most Mississauga areas"

---

#### 5. Unsubstantiated Claims (CRITICAL)
**Line 850:** "Toronto's #1 choice"
**Other instances:** "best", "fastest" without proof

**Fix:** Remove OR add proof:
- "#1 in Google reviews for Mississauga appliance repair (as of Oct 2025)"
- "Highest-rated appliance repair service on Google"

---

#### 6. No Focus Indicators (CRITICAL ACCESSIBILITY)
**Issue:** No :focus styles detected in CSS

**Fix:** Add to design-system.css:
```css
a:focus, button:focus, input:focus, select:focus, textarea:focus {
    outline: 3px solid #2196F3;
    outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

**Impact:** WCAG 2.1 AA violation, users with disabilities cannot navigate

## 12. CONCLUSION

The Mississauga page **requires significant fixes** before deployment. The three critical gate failures (Data Consistency 70%, Content Quality 60%, Mobile Responsiveness 70%) must be resolved to meet BMAD v3.1 standards.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 8-12 hours
**Priority Level:** HIGH - Blocking deployment
**Retest Required:** Yes, full BMAD test after fixes

**Key Takeaway:** Quality over quantity - the page has too much content, not enough structure, and several trust-damaging issues (false claims, fake urgency, inconsistencies).
