3. **Questions > Keywords for AI**
   - "How much does X cost?" beats "X Cost" for AI
   - Question format matches user intent
   - AI can extract direct answers from question-based content

4. **Voice Search = "Near Me" + Urgency**
   - 60% of voice searches include "near me"
   - Voice users want immediate answers (today, now, emergency)
   - Click-to-call is essential for voice conversions

5. **AI Summary Boxes = Featured Snippets 2.0**
   - First 100 words matter most
