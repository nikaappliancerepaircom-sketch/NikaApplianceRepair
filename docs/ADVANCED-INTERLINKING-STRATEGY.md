# Advanced Interlinking Strategy for SEO

## 🔗 Interlinking Architecture Overview

### 1. HUB & SPOKE MODEL
Create content hubs with strategic link flow to maximize authority distribution.

```
HOME (Authority Hub)
├── SERVICE HUBS (6 main services)
│   ├── Sub-pages (Common problems)
│   ├── Related services
│   └── Location variations
├── LOCATION HUBS (5 main areas)
│   ├── Neighborhood pages
│   ├── Service combinations
│   └── Local testimonials
└── BRAND HUBS (8 major brands)
    ├── Model-specific pages
    ├── Common issues by brand
    └── Parts availability
```

### 2. SILO STRUCTURE

#### Service Silo Example:
```
/services/refrigerator-repair/ (Main hub)
├── /refrigerator-not-cooling/
├── /ice-maker-not-working/
├── /refrigerator-leaking-water/
├── /refrigerator-making-noise/
└── /refrigerator-door-seal-repair/

Each page links:
- UP to parent (refrigerator-repair)
- DOWN to children (if applicable)
- ACROSS to 2-3 related issues
- CONTEXTUALLY to brands/locations
```

### 3. CONTEXTUAL LINKING RULES

#### Link Density Formula:
- **Service Pages**: 8-12 internal links per 1000 words
- **Location Pages**: 6-10 internal links per 1000 words
- **Blog/Guide Pages**: 10-15 internal links per 1000 words
### 4. LINK TYPES & PRIORITY

#### Primary Links (High Priority)
1. **Money Pages** → Money Pages
   - Refrigerator Repair → Washer Repair
   - Downtown Location → North Side Location
   
2. **Support Pages** → Money Pages
   - "Why Refrigerator Not Cooling" → Refrigerator Repair Service
   - "Samsung Error Codes" → Samsung Appliance Repair

#### Secondary Links (Medium Priority)
3. **Money Pages** → Support Pages
   - Refrigerator Repair → "How to Maintain Your Refrigerator"
   - Location Page → "Why Choose Local Repair"

4. **Support Pages** → Support Pages
   - Blog post → Related blog post
   - FAQ → Related FAQ

### 5. LINK ANCHOR TEXT STRATEGY

#### Anchor Text Distribution:
- **Exact Match**: 15-20% ("refrigerator repair")
- **Partial Match**: 30-35% ("professional refrigerator repair service")
- **Branded**: 10-15% ("Nika refrigerator experts")
- **Natural/Contextual**: 30-40% ("fix your fridge today", "learn more")
- **Naked URL**: 5-10% (nikaappliancerepair.com/services/)

#### Examples by Page Type:

**FROM Service Page:**
```html
<p>If your refrigerator isn't cooling properly, it might be related to 
<a href="/problems/ice-maker-issues">ice maker problems</a> which can affect 
the entire cooling system. Our <a href="/services/freezer-repair">freezer repair 
experts</a> often see similar issues. For Samsung owners, check our 
<a href="/brands/samsung-refrigerator-repair">Samsung-specific guide</a>.</p>
```

**FROM Location Page:**
```html
<p>Residents in <a href="/locations/downtown-chicago">Downtown Chicago</a> trust us for all 
<a href="/services/">major appliance repairs</a>. Whether you need 
<a href="/services/washer-repair">washer repair in the Loop</a> or emergency 
<a href="/emergency-repair">same-day service</a>, we're just minutes away.</p>
```
### 6. AUTOMATED INTERLINKING COMPONENTS

#### A. Related Services Widget
```html
<!-- Auto-inserted on every service page -->
<div class="related-services">
    <h3>Related Appliance Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>✓ <a href="/services/washer-repair">Washer Repair</a> - Often paired with dryer issues</li>
        <li>✓ <a href="/services/dishwasher-repair">Dishwasher Repair</a> - Similar water-based problems</li>
        <li>✓ <a href="/emergency">Emergency Service</a> - For urgent repairs</li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

#### B. Location Breadcrumbs
```html
<nav class="breadcrumbs">
    <a href="/">Home</a> > 
    <a href="/locations/">Service Areas</a> > 
    <a href="/locations/chicago/">Chicago</a> > 
    <span>Downtown</span>
</nav>
```

#### C. Smart Footer Links
```html
<!-- Dynamic based on current page -->
<div class="smart-footer-links">
    <h4>Popular Services in [Current Location]</h4>
    <!-- Auto-populate based on page context -->
</div>
```

### 7. CONTENT INTERLINKING MAP

#### Service Page Must-Have Links:
1. → 2-3 other service pages (related appliances)
2. → 1-2 location pages (primary service areas)
3. → 1 emergency/same-day page
4. → 2-3 problem/solution pages
5. → 1-2 brand pages (most common)
6. ← FROM all related problem pages
7. ← FROM relevant location pages

### 8. LINK JUICE FLOW OPTIMIZATION

#### PageRank Sculpting Strategy:
```
HOME (100% juice)
├── Main Services (90% flow) - DoFollow
│   ├── Sub-problems (80% flow) - DoFollow
│   └── Case studies (70% flow) - DoFollow
├── Locations (85% flow) - DoFollow
├── Blog (60% flow) - DoFollow
└── Legal/Privacy (NoFollow) - Preserve juice
```

#### Strategic NoFollow Usage:
- External links (unless high authority)
- Login/account pages
- Duplicate content filters
- Thank you pages
- Privacy/terms pages

### 9. ADVANCED LINKING TACTICS

#### A. Topic Cluster Linking
```
PILLAR: "Complete Refrigerator Repair Guide"
├── CLUSTER: "Refrigerator Not Cooling"
├── CLUSTER: "Ice Maker Problems"
├── CLUSTER: "Strange Noises"
├── CLUSTER: "Door Seal Issues"
└── CLUSTER: "Temperature Problems"

Each cluster links back to pillar + 2 related clusters
```

#### B. Semantic Relationship Links
```html
<!-- Link related concepts -->
<p>Problems with your <a href="/services/refrigerator-repair">refrigerator</a> 
often affect the <a href="/services/freezer-repair">freezer compartment</a>. 
If you notice <a href="/problems/ice-buildup">ice buildup</a>, it might indicate 
<a href="/problems/defrost-system-failure">defrost system issues</a>.</p>
```

#### C. Emergency Path Optimization
Every page should have clear path to emergency service:
- Max 2 clicks to emergency contact
- Prominent emergency CTAs
- Time-sensitive internal links

### 10. LINK EQUITY DISTRIBUTION

1. **Tier 1** (Most links TO):
