## ‚ùå WHO IS NOT OUR CUSTOMER

### **We DON'T target:**
- ‚ùå Luxury homeowners ($200K+ income, high-end brands)
- ‚ùå Commercial businesses (restaurants, hotels)
- ‚ùå Landlords with 10+ rental units
- ‚ùå Property management companies
- ‚ùå DIY enthusiasts who fix themselves

### **Why?**
- Luxury brands = hard to get parts, specialized training needed
- Commercial = different equipment, different pricing model
- Large landlords = want bulk discounts, different service model
- DIY = not our customer, they do it themselves
