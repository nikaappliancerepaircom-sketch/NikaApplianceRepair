};
```

    stats: "Join 2,847 happy customers this month",
    cta: "Fix It Today →",
    color: "success-green"
};
```

    headline: "Your Neighbors Trust Us! 🏘️",
    body: showRecentLocalReview(),
    stats: "47 repairs in your area this week",
    cta: "Join Your Neighbors →",
    color: "trust-blue"
};
```
