# Behavioral Triggers & Micro-Interactions Guide

## üé≠ Behavioral Psychology in Web Design

### 1. ANCHORING BIAS
**Principle**: First information heavily influences decisions

#### Implementation:
- Show premium service first: "Premium Same-Day: $299"
- Then standard: "Standard Next-Day: $199" (seems like a bargain)
- Price anchoring: "Replacement Cost: $1,200 | Repair Cost: $200"

### 2. ENDOWMENT EFFECT
**Principle**: People value what they already "have"

#### Implementation:
- "Your appointment is reserved for 10 minutes..."
- "Your free quote is ready" (after form fill)
- "Your technician John is 30 minutes away"
- Progress bars showing booking steps

### 3. PEAK-END RULE
**Principle**: People remember the peak moment and end

#### Peak Moments to Create:
- Instant callback within 30 seconds
- "Wow, that was fast!" moment
- Price lower than expected
- Extra service thrown in free

#### Positive Endings:
- "You saved $X compared to replacement!"
- "Thank you! You're all set. We'll call in 5 minutes."
- Follow-up text: "How did we do? ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
