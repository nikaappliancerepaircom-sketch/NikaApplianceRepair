## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Template Creation
- ‚úÖ Copied `index.html` ‚Üí `locations/richmond-hill.html` (FULL COPY)
- ‚úÖ Preserved ALL CSS and design elements
- ‚úÖ Fixed relative paths for subfolder compatibility

### 2. Content Customization
Changed ONLY Richmond Hill-specific content:

```html
<!-- Meta Tags -->
<title>Richmond Hill Appliance Repair | Same Day | Save $40</title>
<meta name="description" content="Richmond Hill appliance repair experts. Oak Ridges well water specialists. Same-day 24/7 service available. Call 437-747-6737 for fast repairs now">
<link rel="canonical" href="https://nikaappliancerepair.com/locations/richmond-hill">

<!-- Hero Subtitle -->
<p>‚≠ê 4.9/5 from 5,200+ repairs ‚Ä¢ Residential appliance experts ‚Ä¢ Oak Ridges well water specialists ‚Ä¢ Same-day service available</p>

<!-- Schema.org -->
"addressLocality": "Richmond Hill",
"postalCode": "L4C 0R3"
```

### 3. Path Fixes (CRITICAL!)
Fixed all relative paths for subfolder:

```bash
# CSS paths
href="css/" ‚Üí href="../css/"

# Asset paths
src="assets/" ‚Üí src="../assets/"

# JS paths
src="js/" ‚Üí src="../js/"
```

**Why:** Pages in `locations/` subfolder need `../` to reach root-level resources.

### 4. Visual Testing ‚úÖ
- Full page screenshot taken via Playwright MCP
- Design matches index.html perfectly
- All CSS loaded correctly
- Images display properly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Lessons Learned

### Issue 1: Broken CSS Paths
**Problem:** Copied file to `locations/` subfolder, CSS didn't load

**Root Cause:** Paths like `href="css/style.css"` don't work from subfolder

**Solution:** Changed to `href="../css/style.css"` (go up one level)

### Issue 2: Visual Testing Required
**Problem:** BMAD tests pass but page looks broken

**Root Cause:** Text-based tests can't detect missing CSS/images

**Solution:** Always take screenshot after making changes

### Issue 3: Community References
**Problem:** User didn't want specific community mentions

**Solution:** Removed Persian & Chinese references, used generic text

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 2: Test Copy (3 Pages)
Create test pages to verify template copy process:

1. **Vaughan** (luxury, similar to Richmond Hill)
2. **Mississauga** (standard, large city)
3. **Ajax** (standard, smaller city)

**Process per page:**
1. Copy richmond-hill.html
2. Update city name, meta tags, H1
3. Fix paths (already done if copying richmond-hill.html)
4. Test Tier 1-4 (critical tiers)
5. Visual screenshot
6. User spot-check

### Phase 3: Mass Copy (29 Pages)
After test pages approved, copy in batches of 5:
- Batch 1: Toronto, Brampton, Burlington, Oakville, Markham
- Batch 2: Milton, Oshawa, Pickering, Etobicoke, Scarborough
- Etc.

2. Check design matches index.html
3. Verify local content (Oak Ridges, etc.)
4. Approve to proceed to Phase 2

**Expected:** Page should look identical to homepage with Richmond Hill branding.
