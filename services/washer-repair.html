Our diagnostic fee is $119 (limited time offer), but we waive it completely free if you proceed with the repair. Simple fixes like replacing a lid switch or door latch run $150-$250, while more complex repairs like motor or transmission replacement cost $300-$450.

If it's a front-loader, the door lock or control board might have failed. Sometimes the load is unbalanced and triggering a safety sensor. Our technicians diagnose the exact cause within 15 minutes and replace the faulty component. Most spin issues are fixed same-day for $150-$350 depending on the part needed."

For example, a $250 pump replacement on a 5-year-old LG washer makes sense since new units cost $700+. However, if your 12-year-old washer needs a $400 transmission, replacement might be better. We'll give honest advice based on your washer's age, condition, and repair cost. Our goal is to help you make the most economical decision."

                    <h3>Washer Not Spinning or Draining</h3>
                    <p>Your clothes come out soaking wet because the washer won't spin or water won't drain. This is usually a broken lid switch, worn drive belt, faulty pump, or clogged drain hose. We test all spin components, replace the faulty part, and clear any blockages. Most spin and drain issues are resolved same-day with parts readily available.</p>

                    <h3>Washer Leaking Water</h3>
                    <p>Water pools around your washing machine during or after cycles. Common causes include worn door seals, loose hose connections, damaged tub seals, or a cracked drain pump. We inspect all seals and hoses, tighten connections, and replace damaged components. Leak repairs prevent water damage to your floors and belongings.</p>

                    <h3>Not Filling with Water</h3>
                    <p>Cycle starts but no water enters the washing machine or it fills extremely slowly. This indicates a faulty inlet valve, clogged inlet screens, or low water pressure. We test water flow, clean screens, replace inlet valves, and check water supply lines. Water fill problems are typically fixed within an hour.</p>

                    <h3>Won't Start or No Power</h3>
                    <p>Pressing start does nothing or the control panel is completely dead. This could be a blown thermal fuse, faulty door lock, bad control board, or power supply issue. We test all electrical components, check circuit connections, and replace failed parts. Most electrical issues are diagnosed and fixed same-visit.</p>

                    <h3>Loud Noises During Operation</h3>
                    <p>Grinding, banging, or squealing sounds during wash or spin cycles. Worn tub bearings, broken motor coupling, loose drum, or foreign objects stuck in the pump are typical causes. We remove obstructions, replace worn bearings, and fix drum assemblies. Your washer will run smoothly and quietly again.</p>

                    <h3>Excessive Vibration or Shaking</h3>
                    <p>Washer shakes violently and walks across the floor during spin cycle. This is usually caused by an unbalanced load, worn shock absorbers, broken suspension springs, or unlevel installation. We balance the washer, replace suspension components, adjust leveling feet, and test spin stability. Excessive vibration is stopped quickly.</p>

We carry the most common washer parts for all major brands.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We start with a comprehensive 15-minute diagnostic. This covers the motor, transmission, pump, belts, lid switch, and control board. We also check all hoses, seals, and electrical connections. This thorough inspection lets us identify the exact problem quickly.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most washing machine repairs in Toronto cost between $150 and $450, depending on the problem and parts needed. Our diagnostic fee is $119 (limited time offer), but we waive it completely free if you proceed with the repair. Simple fixes like replacing a lid switch or door latch run $150-$250, while more complex repairs like motor or transmission replacement cost $300-$450. We provide exact quotes before starting any work. Call 437-747-6737 for a free phone estimate.</p>

                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A washer that won't spin usually has a broken lid switch, worn drive belt, faulty motor coupling, or bad clutch assembly. If it's a front-loader, the door lock or control board might have failed. Sometimes the load is unbalanced and triggering a safety sensor. Our technicians diagnose the exact cause within 15 minutes and replace the faulty component. Most spin issues are fixed same-day for $150-$350 depending on the part needed.</p>

                        <p>Most washing machine repairs take 45 minutes to 2 hours from diagnosis to completion. Simple fixes like lid switch or belt replacement take under an hour. More complex repairs like motor, pump, or transmission replacement may take 1.5-2 hours. Our technicians carry common washer parts on their trucks, so we complete 85% of repairs in one visit. We'll give you an accurate time estimate after diagnosing your specific issue.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>If your washing machine is under 8 years old and the repair costs less than 50% of a new unit, repair is usually the smart choice. For example, a $250 pump replacement on a 5-year-old LG washer makes sense since new units cost $700+. However, if your 12-year-old washer needs a $400 transmission, replacement might be better. We'll give honest advice based on your washer's age, condition, and repair cost. Our goal is to help you make the most economical decision.</p>
