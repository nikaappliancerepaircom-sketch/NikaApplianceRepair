Simple fixes like replacing a thermostat or door gasket run $150-$250, while more complex repairs like compressor or defrost system replacement cost $250-$450.

The compressor circulates refrigerant to create cold temperatures. If it fails, temperatures rise and food thaws. A broken thermostat won't signal the compressor to run. Defrost system failures cause ice buildup that blocks airflow. Our technicians diagnose the exact cause within 15 minutes and fix it fast."

For example, a $250 repair on a 6-year-old freezer worth $800 makes financial sense. Replace if your freezer is over 12 years old, needs frequent repairs, or the repair exceeds half its current value. Chest freezers typically last longer than upright models. Our technicians provide honest advice to help you make the best decision."

                    <h3>Freezer Not Freezing or Too Warm</h3>
                    <p>Your freezer isn't maintaining freezing temperatures and food is thawing or getting soft. This could be a failed compressor, faulty thermostat, or low refrigerant level. We diagnose the exact cause within 15 minutes and restore proper freezing temperatures fast. Most repairs are completed same-day with parts we carry on our trucks.</p>

                    <h3>Excessive Frost or Ice Buildup</h3>
                    <p>Heavy frost accumulates inside your freezer, covering walls and food items. This indicates a defrost system failure - the defrost timer, heater, or thermostat has stopped working properly. Left unfixed, frost reduces storage space and cooling efficiency. We repair all defrost components and clear ice buildup completely.</p>

                    <h3>Freezer Won't Run or Start</h3>
                    <p>Your freezer isn't running at all and everything is thawing. The compressor relay, start capacitor, or control board has likely failed. Sometimes it's a simple electrical issue like a tripped circuit breaker. Our technicians test all components systematically to identify and fix the problem quickly before all your food spoils.</p>

                    <h3>Loud or Unusual Noises</h3>
                    <p>Your freezer makes grinding, buzzing, clicking, or humming sounds. These noises indicate worn compressor bearings, a failing evaporator fan motor, or loose internal components. Ignoring strange sounds leads to complete breakdowns. We pinpoint the noise source and replace failing components to restore quiet operation and prevent costly failures.</p>

                    <h3>Door Seal Not Working</h3>
                    <p>The freezer door doesn't seal tightly, letting warm air in and cold air out. A worn or damaged door gasket is the usual culprit. This forces your compressor to run constantly, wastes energy, and causes frost buildup. We replace door gaskets with perfect-fit OEM seals that restore airtight closure and reduce energy costs.</p>

                    <h3>Ice Buildup on Freezer Floor</h3>
                    <p>You're finding ice accumulating at the bottom of your freezer compartment. This happens when the defrost drain becomes clogged with food particles or ice. Water from defrost cycles can't drain properly and refreezes. We clear blocked drain tubes, clean drain pans, and ensure proper water flow to eliminate ice buildup issues.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px;">⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4.9/5 rating | 5,200+ repairs | 90-day warranty</p>
            <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #334155;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">When your freezer stops working properly, food thaws fast and you risk losing everything stored inside. That's why we offer same-day freezer repair service across Toronto and the GTA. Our certified freezer repair technicians arrive in fully-stocked service trucks carrying the most common freezer parts for all major brands.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We start with a comprehensive 15-minute diagnostic covering the compressor, evaporator fan, defrost system, thermostat, and door seal. We also test temperature sensors and all electrical components. This thorough inspection identifies the exact problem quickly so we can get your freezer back to freezing temperatures fast.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">During diagnosis, we measure internal temperatures and check compressor operation. The evaporator fan and defrost system get tested for proper function. We inspect door gaskets for tears or gaps that let warm air in. All findings are explained in plain English so you understand exactly what needs fixing.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">You receive an upfront quote before any repair work begins - no hidden fees or surprise charges ever. Most freezer repairs cost between $150 and $450 depending on the issue and parts needed. Our diagnostic fee of $80-$150 is waived completely when you proceed with the repair.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We use only genuine OEM parts or high-quality equivalents that meet or exceed manufacturer specifications. Cheap aftermarket parts might save money initially but fail quickly and can damage other components. Our parts inventory includes compressors, thermostats, defrost timers and heaters, evaporator fans, and door gaskets for all major brands.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Most freezer repairs are completed within 1-2 hours on the same visit. Simple fixes like thermostat or door seal replacement take 30-45 minutes. More complex repairs like compressor replacement may require 2-3 hours. We test everything thoroughly before leaving to ensure your freezer maintains proper freezing temperatures.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Every freezer repair comes with our industry-leading 90-day warranty covering both parts and labor. If the same problem occurs within 90 days, we return and fix it completely free - no diagnostic fees, no questions asked. This warranty proves we stand behind our work and use quality parts that last.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We repair both upright and chest freezers from compact to full-size commercial models. Whether you have a standard Frigidaire, high-end Sub-Zero, or commercial chest freezer, our technicians have the expertise to fix it right. We've repaired over 5,200 freezers across Toronto, earning us a 4.9 out of 5-star rating.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">For older or discontinued freezer models, we maintain relationships with specialty parts suppliers. Even if your freezer is 15+ years old, we can usually source the parts needed. We'll let you know upfront if a part is unavailable or if replacement makes more financial sense than repair.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We're licensed, bonded, and fully insured for your protection. Our technicians respect your home, wear shoe covers, and clean up completely after every repair. You can trust us to treat your property with care while delivering expert freezer repair service.</p>

                        <p>Most freezer repairs in Toronto cost between $150 and $450, depending on the problem and parts needed. Our diagnostic fee is $119 (limited time offer), but we waive it completely free if you proceed with the repair. Simple fixes like replacing a thermostat or door gasket run $150-$250, while more complex repairs like compressor or defrost system replacement cost $250-$450. We provide upfront quotes before starting work. Call 437-747-6737 for a free phone estimate.</p>

                        <span>Why is my freezer not freezing properly?</span>

                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A freezer that's not freezing properly usually has a failed compressor, faulty thermostat, defrost system problem, or evaporator fan issue. The compressor circulates refrigerant to create cold temperatures. If it fails, temperatures rise and food thaws. A broken thermostat won't signal the compressor to run. Defrost system failures cause ice buildup that blocks airflow. Our technicians diagnose the exact cause within 15 minutes and fix it fast.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Most freezer repairs take 1-2 hours from start to finish. This includes the 15-minute diagnostic, sourcing parts from our truck inventory, and completing the repair. Simple fixes like replacing a door seal or thermostat take 30-45 minutes. More complex repairs like compressor replacement may take 2-3 hours. We complete 85% of repairs on the same visit with parts we carry on our trucks.</p>

                        <span>Should I repair or replace my freezer?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Repair your freezer if it's less than 10 years old and the repair costs less than 50% of a new freezer. For example, a $250 repair on a 6-year-old freezer worth $800 makes financial sense. Replace if your freezer is over 12 years old, needs frequent repairs, or the repair exceeds half its current value. Chest freezers typically last longer than upright models. Our technicians provide honest advice to help you make the best decision.</p>
