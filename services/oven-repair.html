This common issue is typically caused by a burned-out bake or broil heating element, faulty temperature sensor, or malfunctioning oven control board. In gas ovens, a weak igniter that can't open the gas valve is often the culprit. Our technicians quickly diagnose whether it's an element, sensor, or control issue and replace the faulty component.</p>

                    <h3>Temperature Inaccurate</h3>
                    <p>Does your oven run too hot or too cold? Inaccurate oven temperatures are usually caused by a faulty temperature sensor (RTD sensor), miscalibrated control board, or worn door seal allowing heat loss. This leads to undercooked or overcooked food and inconsistent baking results. We test the temperature sensor resistance, calibrate the control, and inspect door gaskets to restore accurate temperature control.</p>

                    <h3>Oven Door Won't Close</h3>
                    <p>A loose or misaligned oven door is typically caused by broken door hinges, worn hinge springs, or bent door frame. This allows heat to escape, reducing cooking efficiency and causing temperature fluctuations. Our technicians replace damaged hinges, adjust door alignment, and ensure proper door seal contact. We also check and replace worn door gaskets that prevent proper sealing.</p>

                    <h3>Self-Clean Cycle Failed</h3>
                    <p>Is your self-cleaning cycle not working or door won't unlock after cleaning? This issue often involves a faulty door lock assembly, blown thermal fuse, or overheated control board. The door latch motor may fail to engage, or safety sensors prevent the high-heat cycle from starting. We diagnose electrical connections, test the door lock mechanism, and replace failed thermal fuses or control boards.</p>

                    <h3>Broiler Not Working</h3>
                    <p>When the broil function stops working but baking still works, the broil heating element has likely burned out. The element may show visible damage, breaks, or blistering. In some cases, a faulty broil relay on the control board prevents power from reaching the element. We test element continuity, inspect the control board relay, and replace the broiler element or board as needed.</p>

                    <h3>Control Panel Error</h3>
                    <p>Seeing error codes like F1, F3, F9, or a completely unresponsive control panel? These issues typically indicate control board failure, faulty touchpad membrane, or loose wire connections. Power surges, moisture damage, or component aging can cause control failure. Our technicians diagnose error codes, test control board outputs, and replace the electronic control board or touchpad overlay to restore full functionality.</p>

            <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; color: #334155;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">When your oven stops working properly, whether it's not heating, running at the wrong temperature, or displaying error codes, you need expert oven repair service fast. At Nika Appliance Repair, we specialize in diagnosing and fixing all oven problems, from simple heating element replacements to complex control board repairs. Our factory-trained technicians have extensive experience with both electric and gas ovens, including wall ovens, range ovens, and convection models.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our oven repair process starts with a comprehensive diagnostic inspection. We test all critical components including the bake and broil heating elements, temperature sensor (RTD probe), oven control board, thermal fuse, door lock assembly, and igniter (for gas ovens). Using specialized testing equipment, we measure element continuity, sensor resistance, and control board outputs to pinpoint the exact failure. This thorough diagnosis ensures we identify all issues, not just the obvious symptoms.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We believe in transparent, upfront pricing with no hidden fees or surprises. After diagnosis, we provide a detailed quote explaining exactly what needs to be repaired, which parts are required, and the total cost including labor. Our diagnostic fee of $80-$150 is completely waived when you proceed with the repair. Most oven repairs range from $150-$450 depending on the complexity, with common repairs like heating element replacement typically costing $180-$280. We never start work without your approval.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Quality parts are crucial for long-lasting oven repairs. We exclusively use OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and high-quality aftermarket parts that meet or exceed factory specifications. Our service trucks carry a comprehensive inventory of common oven components including heating elements for all major brands, temperature sensors, igniters, thermal fuses, door hinges, and control boards. This extensive parts inventory enables us to complete 85% of oven repairs during the first visit.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Every oven repair is backed by our industry-leading 90-day warranty covering both parts and labor. This comprehensive warranty means if the same issue recurs within 90 days, we return and fix it free of charge - no questions asked. This warranty reflects our confidence in using genuine parts and expert workmanship. Many OEM parts also include additional manufacturer warranty coverage for added peace of mind.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Our technicians follow strict safety protocols during every oven repair. We disconnect power before working on electric ovens and shut off gas supply when servicing gas models. After repairs, we perform thorough safety checks including testing the temperature sensor calibration, verifying proper door seal contact, checking all electrical connections, and running a complete heat cycle to ensure the oven operates safely and efficiently.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We specialize in all types of ovens including electric wall ovens, gas wall ovens, single and double wall ovens, range ovens (freestanding and slide-in), convection ovens, and combination steam ovens. Whether you have a basic oven or a high-end model with advanced features like true European convection, dual fuel, or smart connectivity, our technicians have the expertise to repair it properly.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Common oven issues we repair daily include ovens not heating, inaccurate temperatures, failed self-cleaning cycles, broken door hinges, non-functional broilers, error code displays, door lock failures, igniter problems in gas ovens, burned-out heating elements, faulty temperature sensors, control board failures, and thermal fuse issues. No matter what's wrong with your oven, we have the knowledge and parts to fix it right.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Time is important when your oven isn't working - you can't prepare meals properly without a functioning oven.

Our average arrival time is just 45 minutes, and most oven repairs are completed within 1-2 hours of the technician's arrival.</p>

                        <p>Most oven repairs in Toronto cost between $150 and $450, depending on the issue. Common repairs like replacing a heating element typically cost $180-$280, while more complex issues like control board replacement can run $300-$450. Our diagnostic fee is $80-$150, which is waived if you proceed with the repair. We always provide an upfront quote before starting any work.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>An oven that won't heat is usually caused by a faulty heating element (bake or broil), broken temperature sensor, malfunctioning control board, or blown thermal fuse. In gas ovens, the igniter may be weak and unable to open the gas valve. Our technicians diagnose the exact cause and replace only the faulty component, restoring your oven's heating function.</p>

                        <p>Most oven repairs are completed in 1-2 hours during a single service visit. Simple repairs like replacing a heating element or temperature sensor take 45-60 minutes. More complex issues like control board replacement or door hinge repair may take 90-120 minutes. We carry common oven parts on our trucks for faster same-day repairs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>If your oven is less than 10 years old and the repair cost is under 50% of replacement cost, repair is usually the smart choice. However, if your oven is over 15 years old, has multiple failing components, or repair costs exceed $600, replacement may be more economical. Our technicians provide honest recommendations based on your oven's age, condition, and repair costs.</p>
