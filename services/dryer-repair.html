Simple fixes like replacing a thermal fuse or belt run $150-$250, while more complex repairs like heating element or motor replacement cost $250-$400.

Sometimes it's simply a tripped circuit breaker or clogged vent restricting airflow. Our technicians test all heating components, check electrical connections, and inspect venting systems. Most no-heat problems are fixed same-day for $150-$300 depending on the part needed."

For example, a $200 heating element replacement on a 6-year-old dryer makes sense since new units cost $600+. However, if your 15-year-old dryer needs a $350 motor, replacement might be better. We'll give honest advice based on your dryer's age, condition, and repair cost. Our goal is to help you make the most economical decision."

                    <h3>Dryer Not Heating</h3>
                    <p>Clothes stay damp even after long cycles because the dryer won't heat. This is usually a blown thermal fuse, faulty heating element, bad thermostat, or tripped circuit breaker. For gas dryers, the gas valve or igniter may have failed. We test all heating components, replace faulty parts, and check venting. Most no-heat problems are fixed same-day.</p>

                    <h3>Won't Start or No Power</h3>
                    <p>Pressing start does nothing or the control panel is completely dead. This could be a faulty door switch, blown thermal fuse, bad start switch, or power supply issue. We test all electrical components, check the door latch mechanism, and replace failed parts. Most power issues are diagnosed and fixed same-visit with OEM parts.</p>

                    <h3>Drum Not Turning</h3>
                    <p>Dryer runs but the drum won't spin, so clothes don't tumble. This indicates a broken drive belt, seized drum rollers, faulty motor, or bad idler pulley. We inspect the belt and drum assembly, replace worn components, and test motor function. Drum rotation issues are typically resolved within an hour.</p>

                    <h3>Takes Too Long to Dry</h3>
                    <p>Clothes require multiple cycles to dry completely and energy bills are climbing. Common causes include clogged lint screen, blocked venting, weak heating element, or faulty thermostat. We clean the venting system, test heating efficiency, and replace weak components. Drying performance is restored quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Loud Noises or Squealing</h3>
                    <p>Grinding, thumping, or high-pitched squealing sounds during operation. Worn drum rollers, seized drum bearings, frayed belt, or foreign objects stuck in the blower are typical causes. We replace worn bearings and rollers, install new belts, and remove obstructions. Your dryer will run smoothly and quietly again.</p>

                    <div class="service-icon">⚠️</div>
                    <h3>Overheating or Shutting Off</h3>
                    <p>Dryer gets extremely hot and shuts off mid-cycle or won't restart until it cools down. This is usually a faulty high-limit thermostat, clogged vent restricting airflow, or failed cycling thermostat. We clean venting, replace thermostats, and check for proper airflow. Overheating issues are resolved to prevent fire hazards.</p>

We carry the most common dryer parts for both electric and gas models of all major brands.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">We start with a comprehensive 15-minute diagnostic. This covers the heating element, thermal fuses, thermostats, drive belt, drum rollers, and motor. We also check venting systems and electrical connections. This thorough inspection lets us identify the exact problem quickly.</p>

                        <p>Most dryer repairs in Toronto cost between $150 and $400, depending on the problem and parts needed. Our diagnostic fee is $119 (limited time offer), but we waive it completely free if you proceed with the repair. Simple fixes like replacing a thermal fuse or belt run $150-$250, while more complex repairs like heating element or motor replacement cost $250-$400. We provide exact quotes before starting any work. Call 437-747-6737 for a free phone estimate.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A dryer that won't heat usually has a blown thermal fuse, faulty heating element, bad thermostat, or defective gas valve (for gas dryers). Sometimes it's simply a tripped circuit breaker or clogged vent restricting airflow. Our technicians test all heating components, check electrical connections, and inspect venting systems. Most no-heat problems are fixed same-day for $150-$300 depending on the part needed.</p>

                        <p>Most dryer repairs take 45 minutes to 1.5 hours from diagnosis to completion. Simple fixes like thermal fuse or belt replacement take under an hour. More complex repairs like heating element or motor replacement may take 1-1.5 hours. Our technicians carry common dryer parts on their trucks, so we complete 85% of repairs in one visit. We'll give you an accurate time estimate after diagnosing your specific issue.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>If your dryer is under 10 years old and the repair costs less than 50% of a new unit, repair is usually the smart choice. For example, a $200 heating element replacement on a 6-year-old dryer makes sense since new units cost $600+. However, if your 15-year-old dryer needs a $350 motor, replacement might be better. We'll give honest advice based on your dryer's age, condition, and repair cost. Our goal is to help you make the most economical decision.</p>
