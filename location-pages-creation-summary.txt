Problem: HTML-encoded versions (&amp;) not matched
Solution: Added both regular and HTML-encoded versions to replacement list

Issue #3: Nearby cities showing incorrect values
Problem: Multiple occurrences of city names in schema
Solution: Used selective replacement with occurrence count for first match only

Issue #5: Unicode characters in Windows console
