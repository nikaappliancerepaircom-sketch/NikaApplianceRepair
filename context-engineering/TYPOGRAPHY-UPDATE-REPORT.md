## Impact Analysis

### Positive

### Considerations
- ⚠️ Slightly less content above fold
- ⚠️ May need to adjust some layouts
- ⚠️ Mobile users see larger text (but still good)

## Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (>1024px)
- Full 18px base size
- Large headings for impact
- Comfortable reading distance

### Tablet (768-1024px)
- Maintains 18px base
- Headings scale down slightly
- Still very readable

### Mobile (<768px)
- 18px base (was considering 16px)
- Headings scale appropriately
- Better for one-handed use

## Next Steps

1. **Test on real devices**
   - Various phones
   - Different age groups
   - Brightness conditions

2. **Monitor metrics**
   - Bounce rate
   - Time on page
   - Conversion rate

3. **Gather feedback**
   - User surveys
   - A/B testing
   - Heat maps

## Rollback Plan

If needed, we can:
1. Restore font toggle button
2. Set base back to 16px
3. Re-implement `.prefer-larger-text`
