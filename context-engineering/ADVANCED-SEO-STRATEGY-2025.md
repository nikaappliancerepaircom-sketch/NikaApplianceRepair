# Advanced SEO Strategy 2025 - Complete Context Engineering Guide

## üéØ July 2025 SEO Landscape - What's Working NOW

### The Triple Threat Approach
1. **Traditional SEO** - Still crucial for rankings
2. **AI Optimization** - Critical for ChatGPT/Gemini visibility  
3. **E-E-A-T Signals** - Google's trust requirements

## üìä Word Count Requirements (2025 Standards)

### Minimum Word Counts by Page Type
```
Homepage: 1,500-2,000 words (currently ~400 - NEEDS MAJOR WORK)
Service Pages: 2,500-3,500 words
Location Pages: 1,800-2,500 words  
Brand Pages: 1,500-2,000 words
Blog Posts: 2,000-4,000 words
FAQ Pages: 3,000+ words
```

### Word Count Distribution Formula
```
Page Structure:
- Introduction (10%): 250-350 words
- Main Content (60%): 1,500-2,100 words  
- FAQ Section (20%): 500-700 words
- Conclusion/CTA (10%): 250-350 words
```

### Why These Numbers?
- Google favors comprehensive content (10x better than competitors)
- AI needs detailed context to extract accurate answers
- Voice search requires natural, conversational depth
- Dwell time increases with valuable, detailed content

## üîë Keyword Density Optimization (2025 Formula)

### The New Density Rules
```
Primary Keyword: 0.8-1.5% (reduced from old 2-3%)
Secondary Keywords: 0.3-0.7% each
LSI Keywords: Natural distribution (15-20 variations)
Location Modifiers: 0.5-1.0%
Brand Mentions: 0.2-0.4%
```

### Keyword Distribution Map
```
Title: Primary keyword at start
H1: Primary keyword + location
H2s: Secondary keywords as questions
H3s: LSI variations  
First 100 words: Primary keyword 1-2x
Last 100 words: Primary keyword 1x
Meta description: Primary + CTA
```

### Example Implementation
```
Primary: "appliance repair toronto"
- Title: Appliance Repair Toronto - Same Day Service...
- H1: Appliance Repair Toronto: 2-Hour Emergency Service
- Density: 15 mentions in 2,000 words = 0.75%

Secondary: "same day service", "emergency repair", "licensed technician"
- Each appears 5-8 times = 0.3-0.4%

LSI: "fix refrigerator", "washer not working", "dishwasher problems"
- Natural inclusion throughout content
```
