## üìù CONTENT GUIDELINES

### For Each Problem:

1. **Question Header Format**:
   - Start with: Why, What, How
   - Include appliance name
   - Include specific problem
   - Natural language

2. **Direct Answer Requirements**:
   - First sentence answers the question
   - Include success rate/percentage
   - Mention typical repair time
   - Be specific, not vague

3. **Quick Fix Tips**:
   - Only include if REALLY works
   - State success percentage
   - Keep safety in mind
   - Build trust, don't oversell

4. **Cost Transparency**:
   - Range, not fixed price
   - Include parts + labor
   - Mention diagnostic fee
   - Compare to replacement cost

## üéØ VOICE AI OPTIMIZATION

Each problem section must work as a standalone answer:
- Complete context
- No references to other sections
- All info needed included
- Natural conversation flow

## ‚úÖ CHECKLIST FOR PROBLEMS SECTION

- [ ] CTAs clear and multiple

## üí° REMEMBER

The goal is to:
1. Help customers understand their problem
2. Show we can fix it professionally
3. Build trust with transparency
4. Make it easy to get help

Every problem section should pass the "Would I find this helpful?" test.
