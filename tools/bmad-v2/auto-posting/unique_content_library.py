    "problems": """
        <h2 id="common-problems">LG Dishwasher Error Code Directory</h2>

        <h3>AE Error - Leak Detected</h3>
        <p>The AE code means water has reached the base pan sensor. This is LG's flood protection system.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Door seal damage:</strong> Check rubber gasket for cracks or debris</li>
            <li><strong>Spray arm crack:</strong> Pressurized water can escape through damaged arms</li>
            <li><strong>Tub perforation:</strong> Rare but serious - requires professional assessment</li>
            <li><strong>Pump seal failure:</strong> Internal leak at the wash pump</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>OE Error - Drain Failure</h3>
        <p>Your LG can't evacuate water within the expected timeframe.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Filter blockage:</strong> Food particles clogging the cylindrical filter</li>
            <li><strong>Drain hose kink:</strong> Flexible hose compressed behind the unit</li>
            <li><strong>Garbage disposal knockout plug:</strong> New installations often miss this step</li>
            <li><strong>Drain pump motor failure:</strong> Motor windings can burn out after 5-7 years</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>IE Error - Fill Timeout</h3>
        <p>The dishwasher isn't receiving water fast enough.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supply valve closed:</strong> Check under-sink shutoff is fully open</li>
            <li><strong>Inlet valve screen clogged:</strong> Toronto's hard water deposits minerals here</li>
            <li><strong>Water inlet valve failure:</strong> Solenoid no longer opens properly</li>
            <li><strong>Low water pressure:</strong> Below 20 PSI causes fill timeouts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>HE Error - Heater Malfunction</h3>
        <p>Water isn't reaching proper temperature for sanitization.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heating element burnout:</strong> Common after 6-8 years of use</li>
            <li><strong>Thermistor fault:</strong> Temperature sensor sending wrong readings</li>
            <li><strong>Control board relay:</strong> Board can't activate the heater circuit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>FE Error - Motor Problem</h3>
        <p>The wash motor or circulation system has failed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motor overload:</strong> Debris jamming the impeller causes overheating</li>
            <li><strong>Capacitor failure:</strong> Motor won't start without working capacitor</li>
            <li><strong>Wiring harness damage:</strong> Connections corroded by moisture</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Reset Sequence:</strong> Before calling for service, try unplugging your LG dishwasher for 5 minutes, then running an empty Rinse Only cycle. This clears temporary errors and recalibrates sensors.

        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Your Gas Oven Won't Heat</h2>

        <h3>The Igniter: Most Common Culprit</h3>
        <p>Gas oven igniters are responsible for 80% of no-heat complaints. Here's how they work and fail:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The igniter glows hot (1,800°F+) which opens the safety valve and ignites gas</li>
            <li><strong>Weak igniter:</strong> Glows orange but can't reach temperature to open valve - takes 60+ seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Dead igniter:</strong> No glow at all when bake is selected</li>
            <li><strong>Cracked igniter:</strong> Visible damage from thermal stress breaks the circuit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gas Safety Valve Issues</h3>
        <p>The safety valve only opens when the igniter proves it's hot enough to ignite gas safely.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Valve coil failure:</strong> Electromagnetic coils wear out, won't respond to igniter</li>
            <li><strong>Stuck valve:</strong> Internal mechanism jammed closed</li>
            <li><strong>Calibration drift:</strong> Valve requires higher amperage than igniter provides</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Burner and Orifice Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged burner ports:</strong> Food debris blocks gas distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Orifice blockage:</strong> Spider webs or debris in gas orifice (common after storage)</li>
            <li><strong>Burner misalignment:</strong> Flames don't reach igniter location</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Temperature Sensor Failures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open circuit:</strong> Sensor wire broken, oven won't heat past initial ignition</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance drift:</strong> Inaccurate readings cause over/under heating</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor position:</strong> Moved or bent sensor gives wrong temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>🔥 Gas Safety Priority</h4>
            <p>If you smell gas at any point, do not attempt any diagnosis. Turn off gas supply at the shutoff valve, ventilate your home, and call your gas utility or a licensed technician immediately.</p>
        </div>
    """,
    "diy": """
        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Safe Homeowner Checks</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Verify Gas Supply</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check that the gas shutoff valve behind oven is parallel to pipe (open)</li>
            <li>Verify stovetop burners ignite normally - if not, gas supply issue</li>
            <li>Confirm gas meter is functioning and account is active</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Observe the Igniter</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove oven racks for visibility</li>
            <li>Locate igniter (usually back center of oven floor or on burner assembly)</li>
            <li>Turn oven to Bake 350°F</li>
            <li>Watch igniter through oven window or door slightly ajar</li>
            <li>A healthy igniter glows bright orange and gas ignites within 30-60 seconds</li>
            <li>Weak igniter glows dim orange/yellow and takes 90+ seconds or fails</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Check Temperature Accuracy</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place oven thermometer on center rack</li>
            <li>Set oven to 350°F and wait 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Compare thermometer to set temperature</li>
            <li>Variance over 25°F indicates sensor or calibration issue</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Inspect Burner Assembly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When oven is cool, remove bottom panel (usually 2-4 screws)</li>
            <li>Visually inspect burner for debris in flame ports</li>
            <li>Check that igniter shows no visible cracks</li>
            <li>Look for any signs of rust or corrosion</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Time the Ignition:</strong> Use your phone timer to measure from bake selection to flame ignition. Under 90 seconds is normal. Over 90 seconds means weak igniter. No ignition after 2-3 minutes triggers safety shutoff.

        {
            "q": "Is it safe to replace a gas oven igniter myself?",

        },
        {
            "q": "My oven heats but doesn't reach temperature - is that the igniter too?",
            "a": "Probably not. If gas ignites but temperature is wrong, the issue is usually the temperature sensor (oven probe) or calibration. The sensor sends resistance readings to the control board to regulate heat. Sensor replacement typically resolves this."

        {
            "q": "How long do gas oven igniters last?",
            "a": "Quality igniters last 5-8 years with normal use. Self-cleaning cycles stress igniters due to extreme heat (800-900°F). If you use self-clean frequently, igniter life may be shorter. Some homeowners see 10+ years with careful use."
        },
        {
            "q": "Should I repair or replace my 15-year-old gas oven?",
            "a": "For a single component failure like an igniter ($175-$245), repair makes sense. If you're facing multiple repairs (igniter plus valve plus sensor), the combined cost might approach 50% of replacement cost. We provide honest assessments to help you decide."

        <h2 id="common-problems">Where Dishwasher Leaks Originate</h2>

        <h3>Door Seal Failures</h3>
        <p>The door gasket creates a watertight seal during operation. When compromised:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardened rubber:</strong> Age causes gasket to lose flexibility, gaps form</li>
            <li><strong>Debris accumulation:</strong> Food particles prevent complete seal</li>
            <li><strong>Physical damage:</strong> Tears or cuts from utensils or rough handling</li>
            <li><strong>Mold/mildew buildup:</strong> Organic growth creates seal gaps</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pump and Motor Assembly Leaks</h3>
        <p>The wash pump circulates water; the drain pump evacuates it. Both can leak:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pump shaft seal wear:</strong> Internal seal allows water past motor shaft</li>
            <li><strong>Pump housing crack:</strong> Thermal stress or impact damage</li>
            <li><strong>Impeller chamber failure:</strong> Seal between chambers degrades</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water Inlet and Supply Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inlet valve failure:</strong> Valve doesn't close completely, water trickles in</li>
            <li><strong>Supply line connection:</strong> Loose fitting at dishwasher inlet</li>
            <li><strong>Cracked supply hose:</strong> Braided lines can fail after 8-10 years</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Immediate Steps for Dishwasher Leaks</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Stop the Leak</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cancel current cycle and turn off dishwasher</li>
            <li>Turn off water supply valve under sink</li>
            <li>Place towels around dishwasher base</li>
            <li>Do NOT pull dishwasher out yet - this can worsen some leaks</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Inspect the Door Seal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Run your finger along entire door gasket, feeling for gaps or debris</li>
            <li>Clean gasket with warm soapy water and soft cloth</li>
            <li>Check for tears, cracks, or areas that have pulled away</li>
            <li>Close door and look for daylight around edges</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Check Under-Sink Connections</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect where supply line connects to water valve</li>
            <li>Check drain hose connection to garbage disposal or drain</li>
            <li>Look for water droplets at any connection point</li>
            <li>Hand-tighten any loose connections (don't over-tighten)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Test Carefully</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place paper towels directly under dishwasher front</li>
            <li>Turn on water supply</li>
            <li>Run a short rinse cycle, watching for leak location</li>
            <li>If leak is from rear or underneath, stop and call professional</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Protect Your Floors</h4>
            <p>Continuous water exposure damages hardwood, laminate, and even tile subfloors. If your dishwasher has been leaking for more than a day, check for floor damage by looking for warping, discoloration, or soft spots. Address any damage before reinstalling a repaired unit.</p>

        },
        {
            "q": "How can I prevent dishwasher leaks?",
            "a": "Monthly door gasket cleaning prevents debris buildup. Running hot water before starting helps seals stay flexible. Inspect supply hoses annually and replace braided steel lines every 8-10 years. Clean filters weekly to prevent overflow backups."

    "problems": """
        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Samsung Ice Makers Stop Working</h2>

        <h3>Frozen Water Line (Most Common)</h3>
        <p>Samsung refrigerators are prone to water line freezing due to their design:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fill tube location:</strong> The tube passes through the freezer door, exposing it to cold air</li>
            <li><strong>Low usage:</strong> Infrequent ice use allows water to freeze in the line</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature settings:</strong> Freezer below -4°F accelerates line freezing</li>
            <li><strong>Defrost cycle issues:</strong> Failed defrost doesn't thaw accumulated ice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ice Maker Assembly Failure</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motor failure:</strong> Ejector motor can't push ice out of mold</li>
            <li><strong>Thermostat malfunction:</strong> Can't detect when ice is frozen</li>
            <li><strong>Mold heater failure:</strong> Ice sticks because heater won't release cubes</li>
            <li><strong>Control board issue:</strong> Ice maker module stops sending/receiving signals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water Supply Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inlet valve failure:</strong> Solenoid won't open to allow water flow</li>
            <li><strong>Low water pressure:</strong> Below 20 PSI, Samsung ice makers won't fill properly</li>
            <li><strong>Water filter clogged:</strong> Reduced flow starves ice maker</li>
            <li><strong>Supply line issues:</strong> Kinks or blockages in household plumbing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Samsung-Specific Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Defrost drain freeze:</strong> Common on French door models, ice builds up and blocks maker</li>
            <li><strong>Door alignment:</strong> Misaligned freezer door affects ice maker operation</li>
            <li><strong>Ice Full sensor:</strong> Sensor stuck or dirty, thinks bin is full</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Samsung Class Action Note</h4>
            <p>Some Samsung refrigerator models have known ice maker defects. If your unit was manufactured between 2014-2017, you may qualify for warranty extension or repair credit. Check Samsung's website or contact them directly about specific model coverage.</p>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Samsung Ice Maker Troubleshooting Steps</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Check the Basics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify ice maker is turned ON (switch/button on maker or control panel)</li>
            <li>Ensure ice bin is properly seated - remove and reinstall</li>
            <li>Check that nothing is blocking the ice chute door</li>
            <li>Verify water supply valve under sink is fully open</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Force Reset the Ice Maker</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate test/reset button on ice maker (usually under front cover)</li>
            <li>Press and hold for 10 seconds until you hear a chime</li>
            <li>Ice maker will run a test cycle (takes 6-8 minutes)</li>
            <li>Listen for water filling (you should hear it)</li>
            <li>Wait 2-3 hours for ice production</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Thaw Frozen Water Line</h3>
        <p>If no water enters during test cycle, line may be frozen:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn off ice maker</li>
            <li>Remove ice bin and any loose ice</li>
            <li>Use a hair dryer on LOW to warm the fill tube area</li>
            <li>Target the area where tube enters ice maker (2-3 minutes)</li>
            <li>Do NOT use high heat - can damage plastic components</li>
            <li>Turn ice maker back on and test</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Check Water Filter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate filter (usually inside fridge or in base grille)</li>
            <li>Replace if older than 6 months or shows reduced water flow</li>
            <li>After replacement, run 2-3 gallons through dispenser to flush</li>
            <li>Reset filter indicator if equipped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Test Water Inlet Valve</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dispense water from door - if water flows, valve is working</li>
            <li>If no water at dispenser either, valve may be faulty</li>
            <li>Check household water pressure (needs 20+ PSI)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Prevention Tip:</strong> Use your ice maker regularly. Stagnant water in the line freezes easier. Even if you don't need ice, dispense some weekly to keep water flowing through the system.

    "title": "Whirlpool Dishwasher Not Cleaning Dishes: Quick Fixes",
    "intro": """
        <p>Whirlpool dishwashers are workhorses known for reliability, but even the best appliances can struggle with cleaning over time. Spotty dishes, stuck-on food, and filmy residue are frustrating - but often fixable without expensive repairs. This guide covers the real reasons your Whirlpool isn't cleaning properly.</p>

        <p>Nika Appliance Repair has serviced over 2,800 Whirlpool dishwashers in Toronto since 2017. Our technicians know these units inside and out, from basic Gold Series models to the premium QuietPartner systems. Let's get your dishes sparkling again.</p>
    """,
    "problems": """
        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Whirlpool Dishwashers Stop Cleaning Properly</h2>

        <h3>Spray Arm Blockages</h3>
        <p>Whirlpool dishwashers rely on powerful spray arms to clean dishes. When compromised:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged spray holes:</strong> Food particles, hard water deposits, and detergent residue block jets</li>
            <li><strong>Cracked spray arm:</strong> Water pressure escapes instead of reaching dishes</li>
            <li><strong>Bearing wear:</strong> Spray arm wobbles or doesn't spin freely</li>
            <li><strong>Upper spray arm disconnected:</strong> Common after loading tall items roughly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water Temperature Issues</h3>
        <p>Whirlpool dishwashers need 120°F water to dissolve detergent and sanitize:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heating element failure:</strong> Water stays cold, detergent clumps instead of dissolving</li>
            <li><strong>Household water heater too low:</strong> Incoming water under 120°F taxes the internal heater</li>
            <li><strong>Hot water run-off:</strong> Long pipe runs mean cold water fills first</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Detergent and Loading Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wrong detergent type:</strong> Pod placed wrong, or using dish soap instead of dishwasher detergent</li>
            <li><strong>Overcrowding:</strong> Water can't reach all surfaces when overloaded</li>
            <li><strong>Blocking spray arms:</strong> Large items or pot handles obstruct arm rotation</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-rinsing too much:</strong> Modern detergents need some food to activate enzymes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Filter and Drain System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged filter:</strong> Food debris recirculates onto clean dishes</li>
            <li><strong>Sump blockage:</strong> Debris settles in bottom of tub</li>
            <li><strong>Dirty food chopper:</strong> Older Whirlpool models have choppers that clog</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Model Matters:</strong> Whirlpool made a significant design change around 2012-2013, switching from food choppers to filter systems. Know which type you have - choppers are self-cleaning but can jam; filters need monthly maintenance.

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Restore Your Whirlpool's Cleaning Power</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Deep Clean the Filter</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove lower rack completely</li>
            <li>Locate cylindrical filter (bottom center)</li>
            <li>Turn counterclockwise and lift out</li>
            <li>Separate the fine mesh inner filter</li>
            <li>Scrub under hot running water with soft brush</li>
            <li>Check sump cavity for debris, wipe clean</li>
            <li>Reassemble and click filter back into place</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Clear Spray Arms</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove lower spray arm (push down center cap, lift off)</li>
            <li>Remove upper spray arm (usually twist-off)</li>
            <li>Hold under faucet and shake to flush debris</li>
            <li>Use toothpick to clear individual spray holes</li>
            <li>Check that arms spin freely when reinstalled</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Run Cleaning Cycle</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Empty dishwasher completely</li>
            <li>Place 2 cups white vinegar in top rack (open container)</li>
            <li>Run heavy/pots cycle with hot dry option</li>
            <li>After cycle, sprinkle 1 cup baking soda on bottom</li>
            <li>Run quick rinse cycle</li>
            <li>This removes grease and odor-causing buildup</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Optimize Loading</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Face soiled surfaces toward spray arms</li>
            <li>Don't nest bowls or cups - angle for water access</li>
            <li>Keep large items at edges, not blocking center</li>
            <li>Ensure spray arms can rotate freely - spin by hand to check</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>⚠️ Detergent Check</h4>
            <p>Never use regular dish soap in a dishwasher - it creates massive suds that overflow. If this happens accidentally, stop cycle, remove dishes, and run multiple rinse cycles. A few tablespoons of cooking oil can help break down suds faster.</p>

Only consider replacement if the wash motor or control board fails on a unit over 8 years old. Whirlpool dishwashers typically last 10-12 years."

        <p>Kenmore refrigerators have been household staples for decades, offering solid performance at reasonable prices. But as Sears declined, many owners wonder who services Kenmore now and whether repairs are worthwhile. This guide covers common Kenmore fridge problems and repair options in the post-Sears era.</p>

        <p>Nika Appliance Repair continues servicing all Kenmore appliances throughout Toronto. We've repaired over 1,900 Kenmore refrigerators since 2017.

        <h2 id="common-problems">Common Kenmore Refrigerator Problems</h2>

        <h3>Who Actually Makes Kenmore?</h3>
        <p>Understanding your Kenmore's true manufacturer helps with repairs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model starts with 106:</strong> Built by Whirlpool - most common</li>
            <li><strong>Model starts with 795:</strong> Built by LG - premium models</li>
            <li><strong>Model starts with 253:</strong> Built by Frigidaire/Electrolux</li>
            <li><strong>Model starts with 596:</strong> Built by Whirlpool/Amana</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Not Cooling Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dirty condenser coils:</strong> Kenmore models often have hard-to-reach coils that collect dust</li>
            <li><strong>Evaporator fan failure:</strong> Cold air doesn't circulate from freezer to fridge</li>
            <li><strong>Start relay failure:</strong> Compressor clicks but won't run</li>
            <li><strong>Sealed system leak:</strong> Refrigerant escapes, cooling capacity drops</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ice Maker Problems (LG-built models)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frozen water line:</strong> Same issue as LG branded units - fill tube freezes</li>
            <li><strong>Ice maker assembly failure:</strong> Motor or thermostat in the maker itself</li>
            <li><strong>Auger motor burnout:</strong> Ice won't dispense even though it's being made</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water Leaking</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged defrost drain:</strong> Ice builds up, melts, water pools under crisper drawers</li>
            <li><strong>Water filter housing crack:</strong> Pressurized water escapes at filter</li>
            <li><strong>Door gasket failure:</strong> Condensation forms and drips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Noise Complaints</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evaporator fan blade:</strong> Ice buildup causes scraping sound</li>
            <li><strong>Condenser fan motor:</strong> Worn bearings create buzzing or humming</li>

            <li>Unplug refrigerator</li>
            <li>Locate coils - usually behind base grille (front) or on back</li>
            <li>Remove base grille (pull straight out)</li>

            <li>Replace grille and restore power</li>
            <li>Repeat every 6-12 months</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Clear Clogged Defrost Drain</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove crisper drawers and shelves for access</li>
            <li>Locate drain hole (back wall of fridge compartment, center bottom)</li>
            <li>Mix 1 cup hot water with 1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>Use turkey baster to flush solution through drain</li>
            <li>If blocked, use pipe cleaner or flexible wire to clear ice</li>
            <li>Flush again with warm water</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Reset After Power Issues</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unplug refrigerator for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Plug back in</li>
            <li>Listen for compressor startup (within 1-2 minutes)</li>
            <li>Allow 24 hours to reach target temperature</li>
            <li>Set freezer to 0°F, fridge to 37°F</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Door Seal Test</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Close door on dollar bill, then try to pull it out</li>
            <li>Should feel resistance - if bill slides easily, seal is worn</li>
            <li>Test multiple spots around door perimeter</li>
            <li>Clean gasket with warm soapy water if sticky or dirty</li>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Temperature Troubleshooting:</strong> If your Kenmore fridge isn't cold but freezer works fine, the evaporator fan is likely the culprit. Listen with the door open - if you don't hear a fan running, that's your problem. Fan motor replacement is a common, affordable repair.

        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Dryers Stop Heating</h2>

        <h3>Electric Dryer Heat Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heating element burnout:</strong> Element coil breaks, no heat is produced</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal fuse blown:</strong> Safety device triggered by overheating, kills power to heater</li>
            <li><strong>High-limit thermostat:</strong> Temperature sensor fails, prevents heating</li>
            <li><strong>Cycling thermostat:</strong> Controls heat cycling, failure causes no heat or overheating</li>
            <li><strong>Partial power loss:</strong> Electric dryers need both 120V legs - losing one means tumble but no heat</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gas Dryer Heat Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Igniter failure:</strong> Glow bar doesn't get hot enough to open gas valve</li>
            <li><strong>Gas valve solenoids:</strong> Electromagnetic coils wear out, valve won't open</li>
            <li><strong>Flame sensor:</strong> Detects if flame ignites, failure shuts off gas</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal fuse:</strong> Same as electric - safety cutoff from overheating</li>
            <li><strong>Gas supply issue:</strong> Valve closed, line problem, or gas service interruption</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common to Both Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged exhaust vent:</strong> Restricted airflow causes overheating and safety shutoffs</li>
            <li><strong>Control board failure:</strong> Electronic control can't send heat signal</li>
            <li><strong>Timer malfunction:</strong> Mechanical timer doesn't advance to heat cycle</li>
            <li><strong>Moisture sensor issues:</strong> Sensor-dry shuts off early, clothes seem wet</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>🔥 Lint Fire Prevention</h4>
            <p>Clogged dryer vents cause 15,000+ house fires annually in North America. If your dryer stopped heating, check the vent immediately. A blocked vent likely triggered a safety shutoff. Even after repair, cleaning the vent is essential to prevent recurrence.</p>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Diagnose Your No-Heat Dryer</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Verify Power (Electric Dryers)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check both circuit breakers - electric dryers use two 30-amp breakers</li>
            <li>One tripped breaker means motor runs but no heat</li>
            <li>Reset both breakers - turn off, wait 30 seconds, turn back on</li>
            <li>If breaker keeps tripping, don't force it - call for service</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Verify Gas Supply (Gas Dryers)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check gas shutoff valve behind dryer - handle parallel to pipe is OPEN</li>
            <li>Verify other gas appliances work (stove, furnace)</li>
            <li>If no gas appliances work, contact gas utility</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Check Exhaust Airflow</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Go outside and locate dryer vent exhaust hood</li>
            <li>Start dryer on air-only cycle (no heat)</li>
            <li>Feel for strong airflow at exhaust hood</li>
            <li>Weak or no airflow = vent blockage</li>
            <li>Disconnect vent hose from back of dryer, run dryer - if airflow is strong, duct is clogged</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Clean the Lint Path</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove and clean lint screen (every load!)</li>
            <li>Vacuum lint screen housing with crevice tool</li>
            <li>Disconnect dryer from vent duct</li>
            <li>Use dryer vent brush to clean duct run</li>
            <li>Verify no crushing or kinking of flexible duct</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Test for Heat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Select timed dry (not sensor) on high heat</li>
            <li>Open door after 5 minutes and feel for warmth</li>
            <li>If drum is warm but clothes don't dry, airflow issue remains</li>
            <li>If drum is cold, heating system needs repair</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Quick Test:</strong> On gas dryers, watch through the small window or crack the door slightly to see if the igniter glows. A glowing igniter that doesn't ignite gas indicates failed valve solenoids - the most common gas dryer repair.

            "q": "How often should I clean my dryer vent?",

        {
            "q": "Why does my gas dryer igniter glow but gas doesn't ignite?",

        },
        {
            "q": "Is it safe to use my dryer if it overheats and shuts off?",
            "a": "No. If your dryer is overheating enough to trigger safety shutoffs, something is wrong. This is a fire hazard. Stop using it until the vent is cleaned and/or components are replaced. Continuing to use an overheating dryer risks fire."

        <h3>Step 1: Check for Drainage Issues</h3>
        <p>Washers won't spin with water still in the tub:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Listen for drain pump running at spin cycle start</li>
            <li>Check that drain hose isn't kinked or blocked</li>
            <li>Verify standpipe isn't overflowing (indicates slow drainage)</li>
            <li>Clean drain pump filter if your model has accessible filter</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Test the Lid/Door Switch</h3>
        <p>For top-loaders:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open lid and locate plastic lid switch striker on lid</li>
            <li>With lid open, use a pen to manually depress the lid switch</li>
            <li>If machine starts spinning, lid switch is likely worn or misaligned</li>
            <li>Check striker for wear - it may need adjustment or replacement</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For front-loaders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify door closes completely and latches audibly</li>
            <li>Check for debris in door strike area</li>
            <li>Listen for locking mechanism engaging</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Redistribute the Load</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open machine and rearrange items evenly</li>
            <li>Remove single heavy items (towels, jeans, blankets)</li>
            <li>For front-loaders, don't overload - items should tumble freely</li>
            <li>Restart spin cycle</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Check Drive Belt (If Accessible)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unplug washer and access belt (usually back or bottom panel)</li>
            <li>Visually inspect belt for cracks, fraying, or breakage</li>
            <li>Belt should be tight - if it slips easily, it's worn</li>
            <li>Belt replacement is manageable DIY with correct part</li>

        {
            "q": "My washer spins slowly but not at full speed - what's wrong?",
            "a": "Slow spin usually indicates worn motor brushes (older models), weak capacitor, worn belt, or failing motor. It can also be a load balance issue - the machine limits speed if it detects imbalance. Try a smaller, evenly distributed load first."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why does my front-load washer shake violently during spin?",
            "a": "Violent shaking indicates worn shock absorbers or struts, failed suspension springs, or possibly broken concrete counterweights. Also verify shipping bolts were removed at installation. Continued use with excessive vibration can damage the machine and surrounding cabinetry."

        {
            "q": "My washer fills and agitates but won't drain or spin - are these related?",
            "a": "Yes! Washers must drain before spinning for safety. If the drain pump is clogged or failed, the machine won't enter spin cycle. Clear the drain pump filter (check owner's manual for location) or have the pump inspected."

        {
            "q": "How long should a washing machine spin cycle last?",
            "a": "Spin cycles typically run 5-10 minutes depending on the load and selected speed. If your washer spin goes on much longer, there may be a balance issue causing repeated attempts. If it ends too quickly, the machine may be detecting a fault."
        },
        {
            "q": "Is it worth replacing a washer that won't spin?",
            "a": "It depends on the cause. Lid switch ($115-175) or belt ($105-185) repairs are almost always worthwhile. Bearing replacement on a 10+ year old front-loader may not be cost-effective. We assess the total repair cost against unit age and provide honest recommendations."

        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Refrigerators Stop Cooling</h2>

        <h3>Airflow Obstructions</h3>
        <p>The simplest problems are often airflow-related:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blocked vents:</strong> Food items pushed against air vents between freezer and fridge</li>
            <li><strong>Overstuffed shelves:</strong> Cold air can't circulate</li>
            <li><strong>Ice buildup:</strong> Frozen evaporator coils block air completely</li>
            <li><strong>Dusty condenser:</strong> Overheating compressor due to dirty coils</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fan Motor Failures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evaporator fan:</strong> Circulates cold air from freezer to fridge - failure means freezer cold, fridge warm</li>
            <li><strong>Condenser fan:</strong> Cools the compressor - failure causes overheating and shutdown</li>
            <li><strong>Fan blade obstruction:</strong> Ice or debris blocking fan rotation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Defrost System Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Failed defrost heater:</strong> Ice builds up on evaporator coils</li>
            <li><strong>Defrost timer stuck:</strong> Never enters defrost cycle</li>
            <li><strong>Defrost thermostat failure:</strong> Heater doesn't activate when needed</li>
            <li><strong>Control board defrost issue:</strong> Electronic version of timer failure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Compressor and Sealed System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compressor not running:</strong> Start relay, overload protector, or compressor failure</li>
            <li><strong>Refrigerant leak:</strong> Gradually loses cooling capacity</li>
            <li><strong>Sealed system restriction:</strong> Blockage in refrigerant lines</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>⏰ Food Safety Timeline</h4>
            <p>Refrigerated food stays safe for about 4 hours if the door stays closed. Frozen food lasts 24-48 hours in a full freezer, 12 hours if half-full. Don't open the door to check - you'll lose cold air. Use a thermometer to monitor without opening.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Emergency Refrigerator Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>Immediate Actions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>DON'T keep opening the door to check</li>
            <li>Place a thermometer inside if you don't have one</li>
            <li>Move critical items to a cooler with ice if available</li>
            <li>Check if freezer is cold even if fridge is warm</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Quick Diagnostic Steps</h3>

        <h4>Check Power Supply</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify outlet has power (test with phone charger or lamp)</li>
            <li>Check circuit breaker for refrigerator circuit</li>
            <li>Look for interior light when opening - if no light, power issue</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Listen for Compressor</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Stand near fridge and listen for humming from the back/bottom</li>
            <li>Compressor should cycle on/off throughout the day</li>
            <li>Complete silence means compressor not running</li>
            <li>Clicking every few minutes indicates compressor trying to start</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Check the Condenser Coils</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Unplug refrigerator</li>
            <li>Remove base grille (front bottom)</li>
            <li>If coils are thick with dust, clean with vacuum brush</li>
            <li>Dusty coils cause overheating - cleaning may restore operation</li>
            <li>Restore power and wait 2 hours</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Inspect for Ice Buildup</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Open freezer and look at back wall (may need to remove cover)</li>
            <li>Thick ice covering indicates defrost system failure</li>
            <li>Ice blocks airflow to refrigerator section</li>
            <li>Manual defrost (24 hours with door open) can temporarily restore cooling</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Temperature Settings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify settings weren't accidentally changed</li>
            <li>Freezer should be 0°F (-18°C)</li>
            <li>Fridge should be 37°F (3°C)</li>
            <li>Some models have scales instead of temperatures - middle settings are typical</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Freezer Cold, Fridge Warm?</strong> This specific symptom almost always indicates evaporator fan failure or ice blocking the fan. Listen for fan running when you open the freezer door. No sound = fan problem. This is a common, affordable repair.

    """,
    "problems": """
        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Ovens Heat Unevenly</h2>

        <h3>Calibration Issues</h3>
        <p>Ovens drift out of calibration over time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature variance:</strong> Oven reads 350°F but runs at 325°F or 375°F</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor aging:</strong> Temperature probe gives inaccurate readings</li>
            <li><strong>Control board drift:</strong> Electronic controls lose accuracy</li>
            <li><strong>Factory miscalibration:</strong> Some units are off from new</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Heating Element Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bake element failure:</strong> Element doesn't glow evenly or has dead spots</li>
            <li><strong>Broil element issues:</strong> Upper element affects convection distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden element damage:</strong> Some ranges have elements under the floor - harder to inspect</li>
            <li><strong>Weak element:</strong> Glows but doesn't reach full heat output</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Convection Fan Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fan not running:</strong> Convection mode without fan circulation creates hot spots</li>
            <li><strong>Blade damage:</strong> Bent or broken fan blades create uneven airflow</li>
            <li><strong>Motor bearing wear:</strong> Slow fan speed reduces heat circulation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Door and Seal Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Worn door gasket:</strong> Heat escapes, temperature fluctuates</li>
            <li><strong>Door hinge damage:</strong> Door doesn't close flush, creates cold spots</li>
            <li><strong>Glass panel issues:</strong> Damaged insulation affects heat retention</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 The Bread Test:</strong> Place slices of white bread across the oven racks and bake at 350°F for about 10 minutes. The browning pattern reveals hot and cold spots. Evenly toasted bread = proper heat distribution.

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Diagnose and Fix Uneven Oven Heating</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Test Actual Temperature</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place oven thermometer in center of middle rack</li>
            <li>Set oven to 350°F and preheat for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Check thermometer reading every 10 minutes for an hour</li>
            <li>Average the readings - variance up to 25°F from set temp is normal</li>
            <li>Greater variance indicates calibration needed</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Inspect Heating Elements</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on bake mode and observe lower element (electric ovens)</li>
            <li>Entire element should glow orange evenly</li>
            <li>Dark spots or partial glow = element failing</li>
            <li>Blistering, holes, or visible damage = replace immediately</li>
            <li>Check broil element the same way</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Check Door Seal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Close door and look for gaps or daylight around perimeter</li>
            <li>Feel for heat escaping with oven at temperature</li>
            <li>Inspect gasket for tears, compression, or hardening</li>
            <li>Clean gasket with mild soap - grease buildup prevents proper seal</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: User Calibration (If Available)</h3>
        <p>Many ovens allow user calibration adjustment:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Consult your owner's manual for calibration procedure</li>
            <li>Typically involves holding specific buttons for 5+ seconds</li>
            <li>Adjust in 5°F increments based on your thermometer testing</li>
            <li>Some models require entering a service mode</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Optimize Baking Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use center rack for most even heat</li>
            <li>Don't overcrowd - air must circulate</li>
            <li>Rotate pans halfway through baking</li>
            <li>Use light-colored pans for more even browning</li>
            <li>Consider a baking stone to stabilize temperature</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">

            "a": "Calibration issues show consistent temperature variance - always 25°F too hot or too cold. If temperature swings wildly, fails to maintain heat, or has hot spots, that's a component problem. Use an oven thermometer over multiple cycles to distinguish the two."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why does the back of my oven run hotter than the front?",
            "a": "Most ovens have a natural hot spot at the back where the heating element is located and a cool spot at the front near the door. This is normal physics. The solution is to rotate your pans halfway through baking. Convection mode helps by circulating air."
        },
        {
            "q": "My oven temperature seems to cycle up and down - is that normal?",
            "a": "Yes, ovens cycle between heating and resting to maintain average temperature. Set to 350°F, the oven might swing between 325°F and 375°F. However, cycling shouldn't be noticeable in your food. If it's causing problems, the cycling thermostat or temperature sensor may need attention."

        },
        {
            "q": "Is uneven heating more common in gas or electric ovens?",
            "a": "Gas ovens are slightly more prone to uneven heating because the burner is at the bottom, creating more stratification. Electric ovens with elements top and bottom distribute heat more evenly. Convection mode in either type significantly improves uniformity."

        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Dishwashers Stop Draining</h2>

        <h3>Simple Blockages</h3>
        <p>Most drain issues are mechanical blockages you can clear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged filter:</strong> Food debris accumulates in the cylindrical filter</li>
            <li><strong>Blocked drain hose:</strong> Food particles or debris lodge in the hose</li>
            <li><strong>Garbage disposal knockout:</strong> New disposals have a plug that must be removed</li>
            <li><strong>Air gap blockage:</strong> If you have an air gap, it may be clogged</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Drain Pump Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Impeller jammed:</strong> Small objects (glass, bones, fruit pits) block pump impeller</li>
            <li><strong>Pump motor failure:</strong> Motor burns out, no pumping action</li>
            <li><strong>Pump seal leak:</strong> Failing seal causes pump to lose prime</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Check Valve Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stuck check valve:</strong> Valve stuck closed prevents water from exiting</li>
            <li><strong>Failed check valve:</strong> Water drains back into dishwasher from disposal</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Installation and Plumbing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High drain loop missing:</strong> Drain hose must loop high under counter to prevent backflow</li>
            <li><strong>Drain hose kinked:</strong> Compressed hose behind dishwasher restricts flow</li>
            <li><strong>Siphoning:</strong> Without proper air gap or high loop, water siphons back</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>🚰 The Garbage Disposal Connection</h3>
            <p>If your dishwasher drains through a garbage disposal, always run the disposal before starting the dishwasher. A disposal full of food waste blocks the dishwasher drain path. This simple habit prevents many drain issues.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Remove Standing Water</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cancel any running cycle</li>
            <li>Use towels or a wet/dry vacuum to remove standing water</li>
            <li>This gives you access to the filter and sump area</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Clean the Filter Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate the cylindrical filter (bottom center of tub)</li>
            <li>Turn counterclockwise and lift out</li>
            <li>Remove the fine mesh filter if separate</li>
            <li>Rinse both parts under hot running water</li>
            <li>Use soft brush to remove stuck debris</li>
            <li>Check sump area below filter for debris - remove anything you find</li>
            <li>Reinstall filter, turn clockwise to lock</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Check the Drain Hose</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Look under sink where drain hose connects to garbage disposal or drain tailpiece</li>
            <li>Ensure hose isn't kinked or compressed</li>
            <li>Disconnect hose and check for blockages</li>
            <li>Verify high loop is present - hose should arch near cabinet top</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Clear Garbage Disposal</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Run cold water in sink</li>
            <li>Run garbage disposal for 30 seconds to clear any debris</li>
            <li>If newly installed, ensure knockout plug was removed</li>
            <li>Use flashlight to look down disposal for the dishwasher inlet</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Test Drain</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 2 cups water to empty dishwasher</li>
            <li>Start a drain-only cycle (or cancel after fill to trigger drain)</li>
            <li>Listen for drain pump running</li>
            <li>Check under sink for leaks at connections</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Quick Reset:</strong> If your dishwasher has standing water but no other symptoms, try unplugging for 5 minutes, then running a rinse-only cycle. Some control boards get stuck and need a reset to initiate the drain properly.

        {
            "q": "Why does water come back into my dishwasher after it drains?",
            "a": "Water returning after drainage indicates a missing high loop or failed check valve. The drain hose must loop up near the top of the cabinet under the sink to prevent backflow. If properly looped, the check valve in the dishwasher may be stuck open."

        <p>When your freezer starts making unusual noises, it's trying to tell you something. Some sounds are normal operation; others signal impending failure. This guide helps you distinguish between the two and understand what repairs might be needed.</p>

        <p>Nika Appliance Repair has diagnosed and silenced thousands of noisy freezers across Toronto since 2017. We understand the sounds these machines make - normal and abnormal. Let's decode what your freezer is trying to say.</p>

    "problems": """
        <h2 id="common-problems">Understanding Freezer Noises</h2>

        <h3>Normal Freezer Sounds</h3>
        <p>These sounds are part of normal operation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Humming/buzzing:</strong> Compressor running - this is normal</li>
            <li><strong>Clicking:</strong> Compressor cycling on/off - normal up to a few times per hour</li>
            <li><strong>Gurgling/hissing:</strong> Refrigerant flowing through system</li>
            <li><strong>Crackling/popping:</strong> Thermal expansion of plastic parts during defrost</li>
            <li><strong>Water dripping:</strong> Normal during defrost cycle</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problematic Sounds</h3>

        <h4>Loud Humming or Buzzing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compressor struggling:</strong> Start relay failing, compressor overworking</li>
            <li><strong>Fan motor bearing:</strong> Worn bearings create loud hum</li>
            <li><strong>Vibration against wall:</strong> Unit not level or touching adjacent surfaces</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Grinding or Scraping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Evaporator fan blade:</strong> Ice buildup hitting fan blade - most common cause</li>
            <li><strong>Condenser fan:</strong> Debris or wire hitting fan blade</li>
            <li><strong>Frost buildup:</strong> Defrost system failure causing ice accumulation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clicking Every Few Minutes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Compressor start relay failing:</strong> Compressor tries to start, fails, tries again</li>
            <li><strong>Overload protector tripping:</strong> Compressor overheating repeatedly</li>
            <li><strong>Bad capacitor:</strong> Compressor can't start properly</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Squealing or Squeaking</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fan motor bearings:</strong> Worn bearings squeal before failure</li>
            <li><strong>Evaporator fan:</strong> Motor shaft rubbing</li>
            <li><strong>Compressor mounts:</strong> Worn rubber isolators</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Diagnose Your Noisy Freezer</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Identify the Location</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Back/bottom:</strong> Compressor or condenser fan</li>
            <li><strong>Inside freezer compartment:</strong> Evaporator fan</li>
            <li><strong>Top (on some models):</strong> Evaporator fan</li>
            <li><strong>Water sounds from bottom:</strong> Drain pan or water line</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Check for Ice Buildup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open freezer and remove food and shelves for access</li>
            <li>Remove evaporator fan cover (usually back wall panel)</li>
            <li>Look for ice accumulation on the evaporator coils or around fan</li>
            <li>Ice hitting fan blade causes grinding/scraping</li>
            <li>If heavily iced, defrost system has failed</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Test the Evaporator Fan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Door switch should stop fan when freezer opens (on most models)</li>
            <li>Press door switch manually to activate fan</li>
            <li>Listen for noise - grinding or squealing indicates bad fan motor</li>
            <li>Spin fan blade by hand - should move freely without scraping</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Check Condenser Fan (If Equipped)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unplug freezer</li>
            <li>Remove rear access panel or base grille</li>
            <li>Locate condenser fan near compressor</li>
            <li>Check for debris (paper, twist ties, dust balls) near fan</li>
            <li>Spin blade by hand - should turn freely</li>
            <li>Clear any obstructions and restore power</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Level the Unit</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Place level on top of freezer</li>
            <li>Adjust leveling legs to achieve level position</li>
            <li>Slight front-high tilt helps doors close automatically</li>
            <li>Ensure unit doesn't touch walls or cabinets</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Quick Test:</strong> If the noise stops when you open the freezer door, the evaporator fan is the culprit. The door switch turns off this fan when you open the door. If noise continues with door open, it's the compressor or condenser fan.

        <h3>Overflow Situations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overfilling:</strong> Water level sensor or inlet valve problem</li>
            <li><strong>Suds overflow:</strong> Too much detergent creates foam overflow</li>
            <li><strong>Clogged drain:</strong> Water backs up and overflows</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>🚨 Immediate Action</h4>
            <p>For any active leak: Turn off the washer, turn off water supply valves behind the machine, and don't use it until the source is identified. Even small leaks can cause major damage if the machine runs unattended.</p>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Find and Stop Your Washer Leak</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Determine Leak Timing</h3>
        <p>When the leak occurs helps identify the source:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>When filling:</strong> Supply hoses or inlet valve</li>
            <li><strong>During wash/agitate:</strong> Tub seal, door seal, or internal hose</li>
            <li><strong>During spin:</strong> Pump, drain hose, or door seal (front-loaders)</li>
            <li><strong>When not running:</strong> Inlet valve not closing or supply hose</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Inspect External Connections</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pull washer forward carefully to access back</li>
            <li>Check supply hose connections at wall valves</li>
            <li>Check supply hose connections at washer</li>
            <li>Inspect drain hose for cracks or loose fit at standpipe</li>
            <li>Look for water marks indicating leak path</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Check Door Seal (Front-Loaders)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Open door and inspect entire rubber boot seal</li>
            <li>Look for tears, holes, or worn areas</li>
            <li>Check for debris or buildup under seal folds</li>
            <li>Pull seal back gently to inspect hidden areas</li>
            <li>Clean with mild soap if dirty - debris can prevent proper seal</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Test Controlled Leak Location</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place dry newspaper or towels under washer</li>
            <li>Run a small load and watch for water</li>
            <li>Note when in cycle water appears on paper</li>
            <li>This helps pinpoint the source</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Inspect Hoses (Preventive)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rubber supply hoses should be replaced every 5-7 years</li>
            <li>Look for bulges, cracks, or rust at connections</li>
            <li>Upgrade to braided stainless steel hoses for peace of mind</li>
            <li>Braided hoses resist bursting and last much longer</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Insurance Tip:</strong> Washing machine hose failures are a leading cause of home water damage claims. Many insurance companies recommend (some require) braided stainless steel supply hoses. The $30-40 upgrade can prevent thousands in damage.

        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Gas Burners Won't Light</h2>

        <h3>Ignition System Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wet igniter:</strong> Boilover or cleaning moisture prevents spark</li>
            <li><strong>Dirty igniter:</strong> Food buildup insulates the igniter, blocking spark</li>
            <li><strong>Igniter electrode gap:</strong> Gap too wide or too narrow for proper spark</li>
            <li><strong>Spark module failure:</strong> Electronic module that generates spark has failed</li>
            <li><strong>Wiring issue:</strong> Connection between module and igniter damaged</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Burner Component Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clogged burner ports:</strong> Food debris blocks gas holes around burner cap</li>
            <li><strong>Burner cap misaligned:</strong> Cap not seated properly after cleaning</li>
            <li><strong>Clogged orifice:</strong> Gas orifice (small brass piece under burner) blocked</li>
            <li><strong>Burner head debris:</strong> Buildup in the burner head itself</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gas Supply Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gas valve off:</strong> Shutoff valve behind stove is closed</li>
            <li><strong>Regulator issue:</strong> Gas pressure regulator malfunctioning</li>
            <li><strong>Gas supply interrupted:</strong> Utility issue or empty propane tank</li>
            <li><strong>Burner valve failure:</strong> Individual burner valve stuck or failed</li>

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Safe Troubleshooting Steps</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Check Gas Supply</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Try another burner - if all burners have issues, gas supply is the problem</li>
            <li>Check gas shutoff valve behind stove - handle parallel to pipe is OPEN</li>
            <li>Verify other gas appliances work (furnace, water heater)</li>
            <li>If on propane, check tank level</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Clean the Igniter</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure stove is OFF and cool</li>
            <li>Remove burner grates and caps</li>
            <li>Locate the igniter (small ceramic piece near burner)</li>
            <li>Use a soft brush or toothbrush to remove debris</li>
            <li>Clean with isopropyl alcohol on a cotton swab</li>
            <li>Let dry completely before testing</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Clear Burner Ports</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove burner cap and head (if removable)</li>
            <li>Use a straight pin or needle to clear individual burner ports</li>
            <li>Don't use toothpicks - they can break off inside</li>
            <li>Brush away loose debris</li>
            <li>Wash burner caps with soap and water, dry thoroughly</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Check Cap Alignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Burner caps must sit flat and aligned on burner head</li>
            <li>Misaligned cap prevents proper flame distribution</li>
            <li>Some caps have specific orientation - check for notches or marks</li>
            <li>After cleaning, seat cap carefully before testing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Dry the Igniter Area</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If recently cleaned or had boilover, moisture may be the issue</li>
            <li>Remove burner components and let air dry for several hours</li>
            <li>Use a hair dryer on LOW to speed drying</li>
            <li>Don't attempt to light until completely dry</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 One Burner Doesn't Click?</strong> If one burner doesn't click but others do, the igniter electrode or wiring for that specific burner has failed. If NO burners click, the spark module (shared by all burners) is likely the problem.

            <li>Check water filter age - replace if over 6 months old</li>
            <li>Inspect supply line for kinks</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Force a Test Cycle</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate test/reset button (often under ice maker front cover)</li>
            <li>Press and hold until you hear a chime or see indicator</li>
            <li>Ice maker will cycle through: fill, freeze, harvest</li>
            <li>Listen for water filling (should hear it flow)</li>
            <li>If no fill sound, water supply or inlet valve problem</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Check Freezer Temperature</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Place thermometer in freezer for 24 hours</li>
            <li>Optimal: 0°F (-18°C)</li>
            <li>Ice production fails below -10°F or above 10°F</li>
            <li>Adjust freezer control if out of range</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Inspect for Ice Jams</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove ice bin and check for clumped ice</li>
            <li>Look inside ice maker for stuck cubes</li>
            <li>Clear any jams carefully (don't use sharp tools)</li>
            <li>Check that ejector arm can rotate freely</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 No Water Entering?</strong> Pour 4 oz of water directly into the ice maker mold. If ice forms and ejects, the ice maker mechanism works - the problem is water supply (inlet valve, frozen line, or supply issue).

        {
            "q": "Should I turn off my ice maker when going on vacation?",
            "a": "For trips over a week, yes. Turn off the ice maker and empty the bin. Stagnant water in the lines can develop odors, and ice left in the bin can fuse into a solid block. This also saves energy and reduces wear."

        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Diagnose Your Squeaky Dryer</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Identify When It Squeaks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Only when starting:</strong> Often belt or idler pulley</li>
            <li><strong>Throughout cycle:</strong> Drum rollers, glides, or bearing</li>
            <li><strong>Louder with heavy load:</strong> Drum glides or support rollers</li>
            <li><strong>Only when hot:</strong> Thermal expansion affecting tight components</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Locate the Sound</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Front of dryer:</strong> Drum glides, front felt seal</li>
            <li><strong>Rear of dryer:</strong> Drum rollers, rear bearing, motor</li>
            <li><strong>Bottom of dryer:</strong> Motor, idler pulley, belt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Visual Inspection</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unplug dryer</li>
            <li>Remove top panel (usually 2 screws at back, lift up)</li>
            <li>Remove front panel (screws at top, disconnect door switch)</li>
            <li>Inspect drum glides at front edges - look for wear-through</li>
            <li>Spin drum by hand - should move freely without grinding</li>
            <li>Check belt condition - look for cracks, glazing</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Test Rollers and Pulley</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Locate drum support rollers at rear (access from back panel)</li>
            <li>Spin each roller by hand</li>
            <li>Should spin freely without wobble or noise</li>
            <li>Find idler pulley on motor mount - spin and check for play</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Consider Repair Kits</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most manufacturers offer maintenance kits</li>
            <li>Typically include: rollers, belt, idler pulley, glides</li>
            <li>Replacing all wear items at once prevents repeat visits</li>
            <li>DIY kit cost: $35-75 vs. repeated single repairs</li>

        <h3>Compressor Won't Start</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clicking every few minutes:</strong> Start relay trying to energize compressor</li>
            <li><strong>Humming then stopping:</strong> Compressor trying but can't start</li>
            <li><strong>Complete silence:</strong> No power or compressor completely dead</li>
            <li><strong>Tripping breaker:</strong> Compressor drawing too much current</li>

        <h3>Compressor Runs But Doesn't Cool</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Runs constantly:</strong> Lost refrigerant or inefficient compressor</li>
            <li><strong>Runs hot:</strong> Overworking due to sealed system issue</li>

        <p>Many cooling problems are misdiagnosed as compressor failure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start relay failure:</strong> $15-50 part, often blamed on compressor</li>
            <li><strong>Overload protector:</strong> Thermal protection device can fail independently</li>
            <li><strong>Dirty condenser coils:</strong> Causes overheating symptoms</li>
            <li><strong>Fan motors:</strong> Failed fans cause compressor to overheat</li>

            <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Quiet hum that cycles on/off every 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Clicking:</strong> Start relay trying to start compressor</li>
            <li><strong>Humming then click:</strong> Compressor motor stuck or relay failing</li>

        <h3>Step 2: Check the Easy Stuff First</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Verify power at outlet (test with lamp or phone charger)</li>
            <li>Check circuit breaker</li>
            <li>Feel condenser area (back/bottom) for heat - should be warm when running</li>
            <li>Listen for fan motors running</li>

        <h3>Step 3: Inspect Condenser Coils</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unplug refrigerator</li>
            <li>Remove base grille or back panel</li>
            <li>Heavily dusty coils cause overheating and compressor shutdown</li>
            <li>Clean with vacuum brush</li>
            <li>Restore power and wait 30 minutes</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Check Start Relay (DIY Possible)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Unplug refrigerator</li>
            <li>Locate compressor (large black cylinder, usually at back bottom)</li>
            <li>Find start relay (small device plugged into compressor side)</li>

        <p>When your dishwasher soap dispenser doesn't open during the wash cycle, dishes come out with food residue and you find an intact detergent pod sitting in the dispenser. This common problem has several possible causes, most of which you can diagnose and often fix yourself.</p>

        <p>Nika Appliance Repair has resolved over 1,100 soap dispenser issues across Toronto since 2017. While this seems like a minor problem, it completely defeats the purpose of your dishwasher. Let's get that dispenser working properly.</p>

        <h2 id="common-problems">Why Soap Dispensers Fail to Open</h2>

        <h3>Physical Obstructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dishes blocking door:</strong> Tall items or handles in the way</li>
            <li><strong>Detergent residue buildup:</strong> Old soap gluing dispenser shut</li>
            <li><strong>Spray arm blocking:</strong> Spray arm position prevents door opening</li>
            <li><strong>Rack position:</strong> Rack pushed too far back or forward</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dispenser Mechanism Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Broken spring:</strong> Spring that pops door open has failed</li>
            <li><strong>Wax motor failure:</strong> Bi-metal or wax actuator doesn't release</li>
            <li><strong>Latch mechanism stuck:</strong> Internal latch won't release</li>
            <li><strong>Cracked dispenser housing:</strong> Damage prevents proper sealing/opening</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Electrical Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Timer or control board:</strong> Doesn't send signal to open dispenser</li>
            <li><strong>Wiring fault:</strong> Connection to dispenser interrupted</li>
            <li><strong>Dispenser solenoid:</strong> Electric release mechanism failed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Water Temperature</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cold water:</strong> Some dispensers require heat to trigger</li>
            <li><strong>Wax motor reliance:</strong> Wax-type actuators need hot water to soften</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>🧪 Dispenser Type Matters</h3>
            <p>Modern dishwashers use either electric solenoid or wax motor dispensers. Wax motors use heat from the wash cycle to melt a wax pellet, triggering release. Electric solenoids receive a signal from the control board. Diagnosis differs between types.</p>

    "diy": """
        <h2 id="diy-fixes">Fix Your Soap Dispenser</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Check for Obstructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Load dishes with nothing blocking dispenser swing path</li>
            <li>Large items, pot handles, and tall glasses are common culprits</li>
            <li>Verify upper rack position doesn't interfere</li>
            <li>Check that spray arm can rotate freely</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Clean the Dispenser</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open dispenser door manually</li>
            <li>Remove any dried detergent with warm wet cloth</li>
            <li>Clean around latch mechanism</li>
            <li>Soak in warm water if heavily encrusted</li>
            <li>Use toothbrush for detailed cleaning</li>
            <li>Ensure spring moves freely if visible</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Test Manual Operation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Close dispenser door until it latches</li>
            <li>Press release button/lever manually</li>
            <li>Door should pop open energetically</li>
            <li>If sluggish, spring may be weak or mechanism gummed up</li>
            <li>If won't latch, catch mechanism is damaged</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Run Hot Water First</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Run kitchen faucet until water is hot before starting dishwasher</li>
            <li>This ensures hot water reaches the machine immediately</li>
            <li>Cold water can delay dispenser opening (wax motor types)</li>
            <li>Check water heater setting (should be 120°F minimum)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 5: Check Rinse Aid Level</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Low rinse aid can affect dispensing in some models</li>
            <li>Fill rinse aid reservoir to line</li>
            <li>Some dispensers are combined units</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>💡 Pod Placement Test:</strong> Place pod directly in the dishwasher tub (not dispenser) for a few cycles. If dishes come out clean, the dispenser is the problem. If still dirty, you may have water temperature or other issues.

            "q": "My washer shows an error but continues to run - should I worry?",
            "a": "Some errors are warnings rather than shutdowns. The machine may complete the cycle but at reduced performance. If an error code appears repeatedly, address it even if the washer still runs. Ignoring warnings can lead to more serious failures."
        },
        {
            "q": "Why does my washer show different codes for the same problem?",
            "a": "Manufacturers update error code systems across model years. A drain problem might be 'OE' on older models and 'nd' on newer ones. Additionally, different codes may indicate the specific component within a system that failed. Always check your specific model's manual."
        },
        {
            "q": "I reset my washer but the error comes back - what now?",
            "a": "A recurring error indicates an actual problem that won't be solved by reset. The first occurrence might be a glitch; multiple occurrences after reset mean a component has failed or needs attention. Time to diagnose the specific cause."
        },
        {
            "q": "Can I look up error codes specific to my washer model?",
            "a": "Yes. Your owner's manual has error codes, or you can find your model's service manual online. Manufacturer websites also have support sections with error code listings. For service manual detail, appliance parts websites often have downloadable PDFs."
        },
        {
            "q": "My washer displays no error but won't work - why?",
            "a": "Not all problems generate error codes. No display at all suggests power issue. Display works but won't start could be door switch, control board, or timer. Running but not cleaning properly might be water temperature or inlet valve. Some problems require diagnosis without code guidance."
