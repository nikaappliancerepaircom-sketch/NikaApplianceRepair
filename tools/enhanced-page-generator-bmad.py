            </div>

            <h2>Common {service_name} Problems We Fix in Toronto</h2>
            <p>Our experienced technicians have seen and fixed thousands of appliance issues across Toronto and the GTA. Here are the most common problems we encounter with {service_name.lower()}:</p>

            <h3>Not Operating Properly</h3>
            <p>When your appliance isn't working as it should, it could be due to electrical issues, mechanical failures, or control board problems. Our technicians use advanced diagnostic tools to quickly identify the root cause. We carry most common parts in our service vehicles, allowing us to complete repairs on the first visit in most cases. This saves you time and gets your appliance back to working condition faster.</p>

            <h3>Strange Noises and Unusual Sounds</h3>
            <p>Grinding, squeaking, banging, or humming noises often indicate worn bearings, loose components, or motor issues. These sounds shouldn't be ignored as they can lead to more serious damage if left unaddressed. Our technicians can identify the source of the noise and recommend the most cost-effective solution, whether it's a simple adjustment or a component replacement.</p>

            <h3>Leaking Water or Moisture Issues</h3>
            <p>Water leaks can cause significant damage to your floors and cabinetry if not addressed quickly. Common causes include worn seals, clogged drain lines, or damaged hoses. We'll locate the source of the leak, explain the problem clearly, and provide an upfront quote for the repair. Our {GLOBAL_DATA['warranty']} warranty gives you confidence that the repair will last.</p>

            <h3>Not Heating or Cooling Correctly</h3>
            <p>Temperature issues can stem from faulty thermostats, heating elements, compressors, or control systems. These problems require expert diagnosis to avoid replacing expensive components unnecessarily. Our technicians test all related systems to pinpoint the exact issue, ensuring you only pay for the repairs you actually need.</p>

            <h3>Diagnostic Fee: {GLOBAL_DATA['diagnostic_fee']}</h3>
            <p>Our diagnostic visit includes a thorough inspection of your appliance, identification of all issues, and a detailed explanation of what's wrong.

Complex repairs may cost more, but we'll always provide a complete quote before starting work. We source high-quality parts at competitive prices and pass those savings on to you.</p>

            <h3>No Hidden Fees or Surprises</h3>
            <p>What we quote is what you pay. There are no trip charges, no weekend surcharges, and no surprise fees. If we discover additional issues during the repair, we'll discuss them with you and get your approval before proceeding. You're always in control of the repair process and costs.</p>
