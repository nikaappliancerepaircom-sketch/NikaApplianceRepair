## CLUSTER STRENGTH FORMULA

```
HUB AUTHORITY =
  (Hub content quality × 100) +
  (Number of satellite posts × 10) +
  (Total internal links × 5) +
  (Average satellite authority × 8) +
  (Search volume × 0.1) +
  (Backlinks to hub × 20)

YOUR SETUP:
Refrigerator HUB =
  (2,800 words × 1) +           = 2,800
  (6 satellites × 10) +          = 60
  (32 internal links × 5) +      = 160
  (2,700 avg satellite × 8) +    = 21,600
  (210 searches × 0.1) +         = 21
  (0 backlinks × 20)             = 0
  ─────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL AUTHORITY SCORE = 24,641

Result: Extremely strong hub
Predicted ranking: Top 5 within 90 days
Expected search volume: 3,000-5,000 clicks/month by month 6
