## Why SEO Scores Remain Low

Despite adding 1,300-2,500 words per page, SEO scores only improved marginally (46‚Üí52/100). Analysis reveals:

### 1. **BMAD's "Optimal" Word Count Threshold**
The BMAD testing framework appears to have a word count target higher than 2,600-2,800 words. Possible thresholds:
- 3,000+ words for "optimal"
- 3,500+ words for "excellent"

### 2. **Image Deficiency**
**Current:** 0-1 images per page
**BMAD Requirement:** 3-5 relevant images per page
**Impact:** Significant penalty on visual engagement scores

### 3. **Missing AI Summary Boxes**
BMAD specifically flags "Add AI summary boxes" on every page. This suggests:
- Quick answer/takeaway sections at the top
- Key insights highlighted with special formatting
- Featured snippets optimized for voice search

### 4. **Other Potential Factors Not Yet Addressed:**
- Internal linking density
- Keyword density optimization (2-3% target)
- Schema markup completeness
- Meta description optimization
- Header hierarchy (H1-H6 structure)
- Alt text for images (when added)
- Page load speed impact
- Mobile responsiveness scoring

---

## Recommendations for Next Phase

To achieve 85+ SEO score, implement these additional optimizations:

### Priority 1: Images (Highest Impact)
**Action:** Add 3-5 relevant images per page
- Blog posts: Add appliance repair photos, diagrams, before/after shots

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Create or source images:
