## CRITICAL FAILURES (MUST FIX BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)

### 1. FALSE MANUFACTURER CLAIMS ⚠️ LEGAL RISK
**Line 903:**
```html
<li><span class="feature-icon">✓</span> Factory-authorized for major brands</li>
```

**Issue:** False manufacturer claim
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - Legal liability
**Fix:** Remove "Factory-authorized" or change to:
- "Experienced with all major brands"
- "We service all major brands"
- "Repair all major brands"

**BMAD Rule Violation:** Section 9 - Psychology (Parameter: No false claims)

---

### 2. DATA CONSISTENCY: WARRANTY PERIOD INCONSISTENT ⚠️
**Found 3 different values:** 90-day, 2-hour, 7-day

**90-day warranty mentions (CORRECT):**
- Line 181: "90-day warranty"
- Line 281: "90-day warranty"
- Line 320: "90-day warranty"
- Line 493: "90-day warranty"
- Line 640: "90-day warranty"
- Line 901: "90-day warranty"
- Line 1174: "90-day warranty"
- Line 1242: "90-Day Warranty"
- Line 1401: "90-day warranty"
- Line 1525: "90-day warranty on parts and labor"

**2-hour mentions (repair time, NOT warranty):**
- Line 564: "1-2 hours" (repair time)
- Line 571: "1-2 hours" (repair time)
- Line 585: "1-2 hours" (repair time)
- Line 599: "1-2 hours" (repair time)
- Line 1069: "under 2 hours" (repair time)
- Line 1409: "under 2 hours" (repair time)

**7-day mentions (service availability, NOT warranty):**
- Line 1257: "7 days/week" (service availability)
- Line 1567: "7 days a week" (service availability)

**Issue:** Regex parser incorrectly identified repair times and service days as warranty periods
**Actual Consistency:** ✅ PASS - All warranty mentions are consistent at "90-day"
**Fix:** None needed - this is a false positive from the automated test

---

### 3. CONTENT QUALITY: 93.3% (Need 98%+) ⚠️

**Current Score:** 14/15 parameters
**Missing:** 0.7 points (need 14.7/15 minimum)

**Strength:** Burlington-specific content is excellent with 76 location mentions including:
- Aldershot (waterfront area)
- Downtown Burlington
- Brant Hills
- Tyandaga
- Freeman
- Hamilton Harbour
- Lake Ontario
- Plains Road
- 1960s bungalows
- Waterfront corrosion
- Aging appliances (43.3-year median age)
- Empty-nester downsizing (2.5 people per household)

**Issue:** Page has 14 sections (optimal is 7-12 per BMAD)
**Current sections:**
1. Hero
2. AI Summary
3. Pricing Table
4. Countdown
5. Services
6. Why Choose Us
7. About
8. Brands
9. Testimonials
10. Common Problems
11. Booking
12. Service Areas

- Combine "Why Choose Us" + "About" into single section
- Or restructure to have fewer, deeper sections
- Or accept 14 sections (only 0.7 points away from 98%)

---

### 4. RESPONSIVE DESIGN: 68.8% (Need 80%+) ⚠️

**Score:** 55/80 parameters

**Issues Found:**

#### Issue 4A: Media Queries - Only 1 Found (Need 3+)
**Current:** 1 media query in inline style (line 349-374)
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .mobile-optimize { display: block; }
    /* ... */
}
```

**Fix:** Responsive CSS files are linked but not analyzed in test:
- Line 399: `responsive-comprehensive.css`
- Line 402: `mobile-overflow-fix.css`
- Line 403: `mobile-bmad-typography.css`

**Note:** This is likely a false negative - external CSS files contain additional media queries

#### Issue 4B: Touch-Friendly Sizing
**Looking for:** 44px or 48px minimum touch targets
**Not detected in inline styles**

**Likely present in external CSS files:**
- `cta-buttons.css` (line 416)
- `mobile-strict-fix.css` (line 401)

**Recommendation:** Verify touch target sizes in external CSS are 44px+ minimum
